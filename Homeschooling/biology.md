## General assignment

Your general assignment for every class is to study the materials, and to **write down the questions that pop up in your head**. Moreover, if you don't understand something, your goal is to express this as a set of questions, and write it down. This is not easy!! But that's a very important activity.

We'll talk more about it later :)
