## Weekly assignment

Your main assignment for this class is to study the materials, and to write down the questions that you have. If you don't understand something, your goal is to try to express this as a set of questions, and write them down.

We'll talk more about it later :)

# Sep 30, Chemistry of life

School textbook: chapters 2.1-2.3 (Matter, Water, Carbon)

Videos:	

* Carbon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnQe0xW_JY4&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF&index=2
* Water: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVT3Y3_gHGg&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF&index=3

OpenStax AP Bio: Chapters 2.2-2.3 (Atoms, Water, Carbon)

# Oct 10, Bio molecules, Enzymes

If necessary, refresh these videos:

* Carbon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnQe0xW_JY4&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF&index=2

* Water: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVT3Y3_gHGg&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF&index=3

But then also do 

* Biological Molecules: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8WJ2KENlK0&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF&index=4

* How to draw organic molecules: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMoA65Dj-zk

In the book, read chapters 2.3 and 2.4 (about enzymes), and then also try to answer questions on page 57

OpenStax AP textbook: Chapters 3.1-3.5 (it's too much info, so just look it through, read about it)

- Letâ€™s use molecule-builder meaningfully. For example, build an aminoacid. Just open the chart, pick any one, and build it.

## Oct 20

Book: read that chapter about ecology, and then the one about energy and what not, and network. All until "carbon and nitrogen cycles" (for now).

- Ecosystem links in the chain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ubvEJ3KGM
- Energy cycle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TitrRpMUt0I
- Food network Khan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xL96QwxwbG0

# Early November

For next time:

The book chapter about matter cycles.

Book: Read Section 3.4 (everything about cycles of matter)

Watch these videos:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D7hZpIYlCA - crash nitrogen & phosphorus
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leHy-Y_8nRs - crash water and carbon cycles

Then do all questions on pages 89-92
Be prepared to explain the answers to me the next time we meet :)

Finally, watch these fun videos about ecosystems:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q - Yellowstone
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTR6gGDWcJk - Thermal vents
* Explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W_ywzhkR90

# Nov 14

Homework for our next discussion class:

- Read the next few chapters in the book: climate, succession, biomes, colonization of volcanic islands, and aquatic ecosystems.

- As usual:

- - Look up all key terms (google / wikipedia), make sure you understand them
  - Write down (!!!) questions that appear in your heads as you work through this material

- Videos:

- - Succession: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZKIHe2LDP8
  - Primary succession: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLpc71YOtcE
  - Second half of this video (about 10 minutes), when they stop talking about geology, and start talking about succession: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0ZnlfDkErM
  - The tomato story: http://nowiknow.com/the-tomato-plant-versus-the-volcano/

# Nov 29

Chapters 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 (it would be population growth, predator-prey, and limiting factors, I think?)

Predator-prey simulations:
Play with this one, and read the description:
https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/lotka-martini/
Understand how it works (not the programming size, but the phenomenology of what is happening, and how the behavior changes, as you play with the parameters)
This is frankly more of a hacker's exercise. Visit this page:
https://ncase.me/sim/?s=prey
Find a way to make foxes and rabbits coexist without extinction, while retaining oscillations (population waves)

Oh, right, I totally forgot to find good lectures for you. So here are the lectures:

- Population biology and population growth
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBOsqmBQBQk&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNdTKZkV_GiIYXpV9w4WxbX&index=3
- Human population growth:
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8dkWQVFAoA&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNdTKZkV_GiIYXpV9w4WxbX&index=4

And also this one, which is not quite ecology, but is related to it in some way, and also is like WOW DUDE MIND BLOWN (but only watch it after you read all the stuff, watched all the stuff, and played with the simulations I shared earlier, as it talks a bit about the math behind it all, and the implications it has):

# ToDo Notes

- Observable notebooks on predator-prey for ecology, as a sort of a lab
