## Weekly assignment

Your main assignment for this class is to study the materials, and to write down the questions that you have. If you don't understand something, your goal is to try to express this as a set of questions, and write them down.

We'll talk more about it later :)

# Sep 30, Chemistry of life

School textbook: chapters 2.1-2.3 (Matter, Water, Carbon)

Videos:	

* Carbon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnQe0xW_JY4&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF&index=2
* Water: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVT3Y3_gHGg&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF&index=3

OpenStax AP Bio: Chapters 2.2-2.3 (Atoms, Water, Carbon)

# Oct 10, Bio molecules, Enzymes

If necessary, refresh these videos:

* Carbon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnQe0xW_JY4&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF&index=2

* Water: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVT3Y3_gHGg&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF&index=3

But then also do 

* Biological Molecules: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8WJ2KENlK0&list=PL3EED4C1D684D3ADF&index=4

* How to draw organic molecules: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMoA65Dj-zk

In the book, read chapters 2.3 and 2.4 (about enzymes), and then also try to answer questions on page 57

OpenStax AP textbook: Chapters 3.1-3.5 (it's too much info, so just look it through, read about it)

## Class plans

- Letâ€™s use molecule-builder meaningfully. For example, build an aminoacid. Just open the chart, pick any one, and build it.

# ToDo Notes

- Observable notebooks on predator-prey for ecology, as a sort of a lab
