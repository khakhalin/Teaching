# How to write a CV / Resume

*Version Oct 02 2020*

## CVs and Resumes

For a student, or a recent graduate, the difference between a CV and a resume is not that huge. Both list your history in the reverse chronological order, both need to be easy to read and punchy, and present you in the best possible light. But at least in theory, there are some differences:

| Resume                                                       | CV                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Used when applying for non-academic jobs in the US           | Used for academic jobs in the US, and for all jobs in Europe |
| Exactly one page long                                        | May be way longer (3-4 pages in industry, 10+ pages in academia) |
| Mostly concentrates on what you have achieved, and the impact your work had | Mostly describes what you have done: what techniques you used, what responsibilities you had, etc. |
| Always have a "Skills" section                               | In academia, often don't have a "Skills" section             |
| Use a bit fancier layout, for example 2 columns: wide column for your work history; a thinner column for skills | Usually, just a really long list of bullet points            |

In practice, I think it's easier to first write a somewhat longer CV, and then later distill it into a puncher, flashier resume if necessary.

## How to write a CV

This is a step-by-step guide into writing your first CV. Keep it open, read it carefully, and follow the steps! If you start completely from scratch, writing a good CV should take you approximately one full working day, so plan accordingly! It's not something that can be done in 15 min, but it is worth it!

1. Google articles about "how to write a CV" for an hour or two. **Google 20 different CVs/resumes** in your field of interest. (For example, Google for "ecology resume filetype:pdf"). Save them on your computer. Think about what you like and what you don't like about each of them.  Think of what seems helpful, and what may be annoying.
2. Open a new document. Think of the style and layout. Remember that your CV should be **clear and easy to read**. Don't use ridiculous formatting and ornate decorative fonts. Use clear subtitles, bulleted lists, tabulation. Provide enough white spacing around the text. You want your CV to be very easy (and thus pleasant!) to read when somebody goes through a pile of 200 applications.
3. Start with education section. Use **reverse chronological order** (newer items higher, older items lower). Your recent experiences are more relevant; you want them to stand out. The same will apply to "Awards" section (if you have it), and "Work Experience" section.
4. **Use active language!** Avoid words "helped, participated, assisted, contributed". Say "did, developed, created, built". Example: if you were a part of a team that built a house, don't say "helped to build a house"; say "built a house". If you contributed to something, you DID it (you were among those who did it). If really insecure, say "as a part of a larger team, built a house". 
5. Follow the "**Show donâ€™t tell**" rule: e.g. instead of "experience in riding horses" write "Rode horses for 5 years". Use simple, active, laconic language.
6. Use the word "I" in every sentence, but then delete them. That sounds weird, but resumes have their own style, and any other grammar is punished. "As a manager, built a house. Started a club. Performed an opera. In January, recorded more data".
7. Use **bullet points**, but try to make each "point" one line long. Don't waste space!
8. You may make some **keywords** bold, to make the resume easier to read. It's not required, but may help.
9. Think of all "**bragging points**" you have; all achievements, all skills. Some of them may be general skills (meeting deadlines, working under stress, interpersonal skills etc.), but try to illustrate each one with a specific example, if possible.  Then find each "Bragging point" a place in your CV. If it is substantial, make it a separate point (project, award, skill). If it is small, include it into some other "bullet-point-row". But every good thing you have to say should be mentioned somewhere, once!
10. Describe **results and achievements**, not just experiences or responsibilities. Rephrase, translate them into achievements! Instead of "responsible for painting houses", write "Painted 23 houses".
11. Don't include a section about hobbies and interests. However do advertise relevant hobbies somewhere: frame them as personal projects, volunteer work, outreach, social engagement etc.
12. Keep a longer version of your CV saved somewhere, and update it regularly. Create tailored, targeted versions for actual applications. When applying for position, make a copy of your long version, move sections around if necessary, rephrase / omit parts that are less relevant. Each experience can be pitched in several different ways, depending on where you apply.

## The structure of a typical undergraduate CV / Resume

1. **Header**: name, contact information (phone, e-mail). No photo, gender or age (for legal reasons).

2. **Education** (high school and up). Include relevant coursework. Include the title of your Bard sproj, and the name of your supervisor. If you had some other course projects that are relevant for this job, add their titles in brackets after the name of this course (final project: Title of the project).

3. **Awards, fellowships, scholarships**. Think of all cases when you won *anything* competitive (math competitions, school awards, cum laude, any kind of funding, stipend, fellowship, scholarship, travel award etc.) 

1. **Publications** (if you have them).

6. **Conference presentations and talks**. If you ever presented a poster (including locally, in college!) or gave a scientific talk anywhere, cite it. Format: Title, author(s), date, name of the event, city, state.

7. **Research experience.** When applying for academic jobs, separate your work experiences into 3 groups: Research, Teaching, and Other (see below). List all research experiences here (summer research, senior projects, advanced methodology courses etc.), regardless of whether you were paid for it. For each position, include the period of time when it happened, the place where you worked, a title and a brief description of the project (1-2 sentences). You may try to include here projects for lab courses that had a substantial independent project at the end, either experimental or computational (but don't oversell it - you will be asked about it in the interview). Still, think of it as a portfolio: some works are large, some are small, but all of them matter.
8. If you taught anyone (TA, content or writing tutor, trainer, peer councilor, summer camp volunteer etc.) more than once, and if applying for academic positions, you may also include a separate **Teaching** section and move these experiences there. Otherwise, include it in the employment section. Explain in one sentence what the gig was about (how many students, for how long (days / hours), what have you taught).

8. **Other professional experiences and volunteering**. On top of standard "when and where", include your title, and a description of your results and successes at this job (responsibilities, framed as achievements - see above). Frame your experiences in a relevant way, and if you cannot use it to showcase your technical skills, make it a testament to your excellent "soft skills" (project management, time management, leadership, interpersonal skills, communication). If you worked as a barista, make it sound like a time management success story; if you built a barn, pitch it as project management, budgeting, and purchasing; camp counselor may be a demo of your conflict resolution talents etc. Write more (2-3 lines) about positions that are more relevant (e.g. research, when applying for a fellowship). Use active language, and full, simple sentences. Use numbers (12 students, $4000 budget, in 2 weeks, 68 hours) where applicable, to make your statements more specific. Make sure not to double-count: if something is described in detail in one section, it should not be described again in another section.

9. **Outreach, service, and social work**. Place here all oddball experiences you'd like to mention (choir leader, dorm assistant, altar server). Add cases when you meaningfully interacted with younger kids (including babysitting): make sound a bit like teaching and mentoring.

10. **Skills**. Ideally, make them go on the side column. Think of your *entire life* and try to remember *all skills* you ever tried to master. This is the only section where you don't use full sentences, but just write keywords. Organize skills by category: 

* **Computing and software**: list *all programs* (except games and messaging apps) you ever used, and all programming languages you ever tried. Classify them by level of expertise (*Expert*: MS Office, Google office, Photoshop; *Proficient*: R, Image J, Audacity; *Have experience with*: everything else you used *even once*)

* **Technical**: list *all scientific methods you ever used*, even if it was in a 3-hour-long lab in one course. Round up towards more general or fancy names (extracellular recordings, fluorescent microscopy, ecological transects, liquid chromatography, western blotting, field reports, psychophysiology experiments, PCR, vegetation sampling etc.) Group by subtopic (ecology, chemistry, molecular biology). Literally, open your old syllabi, and go through the list of labs. If you draw or make professional photos, it may also go here.
* **Analytical and problem solving** (e.g.: statistical analysis, data presentation, equipment troubleshooting, experiment design) 
* **Organizational and leadership skills**: read online **about project** and **time management** for an hour, and then frame your experiences in these terms. You can also talk about teamwork, deadlines, long or odd hours etc. Prove your claims where possible: "can work under stress (spent a summer as a camp councilor supervising 200 kids age 3-6)". If applicable, describe situations when you supervised other people's work.
* **Communication**: your writing, presentation, sales, customer skills â€“ there are many ways to pitch it. List experiences that characterize you as a good team player (but don't overdo it; America is biased towards leaders).
* **Languages**: English (native), French (fluent), German (intermediate), Japanese (beginner)
* **Other**: if you played violin or danced for 7 years, put it here. Even if it is not relevant, it will show that you can persevere and achieve results.

Once you have a CV, start a LinkedIn account. Populate it with items from your CV. Then add all your friends and all professors who know you (from class, as advisors, etc.). It is a professional network, so adding professors is encouraged. The more actual real people that you know you add â€“ the better. But don't add random strangers: they are useless, and are probably bots anyway. Linkedin is crucial for jobs and fellowships. You want to be googlable, and you want to control the information they see.

# List of braggable points for undergraduates

It is better to have interesting unrelated achievements than no achievements at all. Those who read your CV want to make sure that you are passionate, active, persistent, reliable, hard-working, and that you can get good at things. So don't be afraid to include achievements that seem to be unrelated to your application, as long as they prove good character traits and working habits.

As you get more relevant experiences, in about 10 years from now, you may gradually start to remove some of the tangential ones from your CV, but for now everything is fair game. Sit for an hour, and think really hard, have you ever: 

* Got an official recognition of any sort
* Won any kind of academic-ish award. (projects, papers, science fairs, exceptional grades)
* Did something interesting for your school
* Published articles or photos in any journal, including student-run journals
* Participated in exhibitions of any sort
* Got any certificates in anything braggable
* Were paid for work (even if it was a summer job for one week, or a one-time side project)
* Helped your parent, their friends, or any other professionals at work (especially if their job is relevant to your application)
* Organized an event, either as a charismatic leader, or as a nuts-and-bolts logistics organizer, a treasurer, etc. (describe your role)
* Participated in a committee or a working group
* Were active in a club of more than five people. Even if the club itself is not relevant, being proactive, organizing stuff, and achieving any level of success *is* relevant
* Served (even if unofficially and without pay) as an assistant to somebody doing something useful
* Tutored younger kids academically (even if unofficially)
* Were invited as a speaker, or a panelist

[Career Basics booklet](http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/documents/careers_basics_book.pdf) from Science (pdf). Covers CVs, funding, career options, networking, gender and inclusion, leadership skills, and other useful stuff.

A sample very useful article from this collection: [How to get a great recommendation letter](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/06/getting-great-recommendation-letter) (many advices they give are also relevant for CV writing)

[The professor is in](http://theprofessorisin.com/): lots of very useful, practical and appropriately motivational advice, mostly targeted at graduate students, postdocs and early professors. Yet make sure to read it while or before applying to grad school; use "categories" on the right to navigate through the blog. Read about interviews, CVs, cover letters. A great undergraduate should behave like an average grad student; a great grad student should behave like an average postdoc or noob assistant professor. That a practical goal to have.
