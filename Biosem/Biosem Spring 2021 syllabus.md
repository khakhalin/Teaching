# Biosem - Spring 2021 - Syllabus

*Version Feb 03 2021*

## Goals of this course

The idea of this course (Biology Seminar) is to give you a chance to listen to, and interact with some people outside of Bard. We try to invite a good mix of all fields and career stages: our recent graduates, PhD students, postdocs, younger professors, older professors, people working in NGOs, conservation, industry, museums, journalism, and so on. We also try to cover different types of biology, from tiny molecules to entire planets. And we also try to make people talk not only about their science, but also about their story: decisions they made, problems and setbacks they experienced, the human behind the job. I think we don't have enough of these discussions; people don't write about their dreams and struggles in their scientific papers or on official CVs. So I try to use these seminars to talk about it.

## This year is special

Due to the pandemics, this semester the Biology Seminar will happen online, as a Zoom webinar.

To make it useful, and less like a pre-recorded Youtube lecture (because why running it live then?), we'll follow a "Questions and Answers" format. The lecture part will only last for about 20 minutes, and after it we'll switch to Q&A with the speaker, where you would ask questions, and they would answer. Or maybe I should market it as AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions instead?

But this means two things. First, as it is impossible to explain a project in 20 minutes, we'll have to come to these lectures prepared. **Every speaker will share some reading** with us ahead of time; either a review, or a recent research paper. We will need to read it before the seminar, not to look like complete noobs. To help you find willpower to read these readings, I'll ask you to submit a short response to each of them before class (see below).

And second: **to have a good Q&A, I'll need your participation**. To learn something from these talks, you need to ask questions that interest you. It's your opportunity to ask *anything*, and ask anonymously. And from the speaker's point of view, they'll be talking to a camera, with my lonely face weirdly placed in the corner (it's not a standard Zoom class, so they won't see you, just a list of your names). Its actually a rather painful experience, and the only way to make it feel good for them, is to give some activity in return; some actual questions! Ideally, asked "in your own voice" (there's a way for that, see below), but anonymous questions in Q&A are also good. So please, please let's try to build this vibe, this spirit of a live session ðŸ™‚

## Tools and Logistics

We're meeting **almost every Thursday** from 12:00 till 13:10. You have from 12:00 till 12:10 to connect to the webinar, and **at 12:10 we will promptly start**.

We'll be using:

* **Slack** to communicate about the course, share files, etc. I'll send you an invite by email.
* **Google forms** to collect your responses to assigned reading before each meeting.
* **Zoom webinars** for actual meetings. I'll send you the link by email + it will be posted on Slack.
* **Email** for emergency notifications, or personal questions.

Before classes even start, make sure to:

* **update Zoom to the latest version** (go to https://zoom.us/download, download and install the latest version). This is important, as old versions don't support all features that we will be using.
* **Make sure your email and names are set correctly on Zoom**. Go to Zoom website (https://zoom.us/) log in, go to `My Account`,  `Profile`.
* Make sure you have your full name on Zoom; the **name that you want people to actually use** (especially if it differs from your legal name).
* Make sure you **put your Bard email on Zoom:**  on the `Profile` page, find `Sign-In Email`, click `Edit`, and put **your Bard email** there. This is important (ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥): I will use these emails to automatically track **attendance** with Zoom logs. If you don't put your Bard email, I won't recognize you in the log, and thus won't count this meeting for attendance.

## A typical week

1. About a week before the seminar, the speaker will **share a paper with us**. Something to read, to get prepared.
2. I'll create a **Slack channel** for each week, on our Slack server, and post this reading there. I'll also post some info about the speaker, so that we could think of what we want to ask them!
3. I will also post a l**ink to a one-question google form**. To a get a credit for this session (to show that you did the reading and thought about it), please submit a reasonable honest question that you had after reading the materials. Please make sure to do it before **midnight previous day**, so that I could look through your questions in the morning before the seminar.
4. During the webinar, after the short 20-min talk, **please ask questions!** You'll have 2 ways to ask questions:
   * Best approach: ask a question "in-person", with your own voice. Do to so, "**raise a hand**" on Zoom (there's a button for it); I will see it, and will **temporarily promote you to a "Question asker"**. If you updated Zoom since Summer 2020, **your camera won't turn on** (and in fact you won't be able to turn your camera on even if you wanted to haha). Once you're done asking your question, I'll make you a "normal participant once again." That's the best approach, as it will make our speakers happy. It will look human!
   * But if you are shy, you can also ask a question anonymously in the Q&A session. And I will read it for you :)
5. Last semester, I also asked lots of your questions from the Google form, just talking all the time. On some talks we'd get like 1-2 realtime questions from the audience, but mostly it was on me. I didn't like it. It's better than a youtube monologue, but much worse than a real Q&A; it doesn't give a feeling of a live audience. So we need to change that. Somehow lower the threshold for asking questions, and make it feel more like a real Q&A. If you have any ideas for how to make it happen, please let me know!

## Grading

The course is taken Pass / Fail. To get a pass, you need to submit 80% of "Reading reflections" and attend 80% of Zoom talks. Zoom attendance will be taken automatically, using Zoom logs.

In practice, 80% of 13 seminars = 10, which means that you can miss up to 3 talks no questions asked.
