# Biosem - Spring 2021 - Syllabus

## Goals of this course

The idea of this course (Biology Seminar) is to give you a chance to listen to, and interact with some people outside of Bard. We try to invite a good mix of all fields and career stages: our recent graduates, PhD students, postdocs, younger professors, older professors, people working in NGOs, conservation, industry, museums, journalism, and so on. We also try to cover different types of biology, from tiny molecules to entire planets. And we also try to make people talk not only about their science, but also about their story: decisions they made, problems and setbacks they experienced, the human behind the job. I think we don't have enough of these discussions; people don't write about their dreams and struggles in their scientific papers or on official CVs. So I try to use these seminars to talk about it.

## This year is special

Due to the pandemics, this semester the Biology Seminar will happen online, as a Zoom webinar.

To make it useful, and less like a pre-recorded Youtube lecture (because why running it live then?), we'll follow a "Questions and Answers" format. The lecture part will only last for about 20 minutes, and after it we'll switch to Q&A with the speaker, where you would ask questions, and they would answer. Or maybe I should market it as AMA (Ask Me Anything) sessions instead?

But this means two things. First, as it is impossible to explain a project in 20 minutes, we'll have to come to these lectures prepared. Every speaker will share one piece of reading with us ahead of time; either a review, or a recent research paper. We will need to read it before the seminar, not to look like complete noobs. To help you find willpower to read these readings, I'll ask you to submit a short response to each of them before class (see below).

And second: to have a good Q&A, I'll need your participation. To learn something from these talks, you need to ask questions that interest you. It's your opportunity to ask *anything*, and ask anonymously. And from the speaker's point of view, they'll be talking to a camera, with my lonely face weirdly placed in the corner (it's not a standard Zoom class, so they won't see you, just a list of your names). Its actually a rather painful experience, and the only way to make it feel good for them, is to give some activity in return; some actual questions! Ideally, asked "in your own voice" (there's a way for that, see below), but anonymous questions in Q&A are also good. So please, please let's try to build this vibe, this spirit of a live session üôÇ

## Tools

We'll be using:

* **Slack** to communicate about the course, share files, etc. üõë Or should I use something else?
* **Google forms** to collect your responses to assigned reading before each meeting.
* **Zoom webinars** for actual meetings.
* **Email** for emergency notifications, or personal questions.

Before classes even start, make sure to:

* **update Zoom to the latest version** (go to https://zoom.us/download, download and install the latest version). This is important, as old versions don't support all features that we will be using.
* **Make sure your email and names are set correctly on Zoom**. Go to Zoom website (https://zoom.us/) log in, go to `My Account`,  `Profile`.
* Make sure you have your full name on Zoom; the **name that you want people to actually use** (especially if it differs from your legal name).
* Make sure you **put your Bard email on Zoom:**  on the `Profile` page, find `Sign-In Email`, click `Edit`, and put **your Bard email** there. The reason this is important: I will use these emails to automatically track **attendance** with Zoom logs. If you don't put your Bard email, I won't be able to recognize you in the log, and thus won't count this meeting for attendance.

## A typical week

1. About a week ahead of each seminar, the speaker will share a paper with us. Something to read, to get prepared.
2. üõë I stopped here for now.
3. I'll create a Slack channel for each seminar, on our Slack server, and I'll post this reading there. I'll ask you all to read it, and also learn a bit about the speaker, and then think of what we want to ask them!
4. I will also post a link to a one-question google form. To a get a credit for this session (to show that you did the reading and thought about it), please submit a reasonable honest question that you had after reading the reading on this google form. Please make sure to do it before the seminar starts, to guarantee that you come to the seminar prepared.
5. If you also want me to ask this question during the Q&A session with the speaker, please either post your question before 9 am on Thursday, or post it on Slack! Also, feel free to use Slack for "personal"-style questions, about speaker's career, plans, experiences, general life advice, or personal anecdotes!
   * ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the only point in this entire syllabus that is a tiny bit tricky. The google form response is to show that you did the reading, so it needs to be about the reading. The Slack questions may be personal :) On some weeks you may only post the "for-credit" question (GoogleForm), and not the "I'm actually interested in what you think"  (Slack) question; that's OK!
6. During the talk, you will have 3 ways to ask questions (given in order or preference):
   * Best: ask a question "in-person", with your own voice. Do to so, "raise a hand"; I will see it, and will temporarily promote you to a "Question asker". If you updated Zoom since Summer 2020, your camera won't turn on (and in fact you cannot turn your camera on even if you want to). If you haven't updated Zoom since prehistorical times of Spring 2020, it may turn your camera on. (So better, just update Zoom :)
   * If too shy, use the Zoom native Q&A functionality.
   * If Q&A doesn't work for some reason, you can also post a question on Slack; I will monitor it.

## Grading

The course is taken Pass / Fail. To get a pass, you need to submit 80% of "Reading reflections" and attend 80% of Zoom talks. Zoom attendance will be taken automatically, using Zoom logs (so please make sure that your @bard email is shown correctly on your profile, as Zoom logs are organized by email)

In practice, 80% of 14 seminars = 11, which means that you can miss up to 3 talks no questions asked. 

## Draft Schedule

The schedule is still a bit in flux, but it will be settled soon!
