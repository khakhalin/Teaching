# Biosem - Spring 2021 - Syllabus

## Goals of this course

The idea of the Biology Seminar is to give you an opportunity to listen to, and to interact with some people who are not at Bard right now. We try to invite some recent graduates, PhD students, postdocs, younger professors, older professors, but also journalists, conservation specialists, museum workers, and so on. We also try to cover different fields of biology, from tiny molecules to entire planets. Finally, at least when I teach Biosem, I always try to trick people into talking not just about their science, but also about their life; their story, decisions they made, problems and setbacks they had. I think we don't have a good venue to talk about these topics; people don't usually mention their personal stories in scientific papers, and it's really a shame, as ultimately science is something that's done by humans, and for humans, so these stories are immensely important. We'll try to talk about them!

## This year is special

Due to the pandemics, the Biology Seminar will happen online this semester, as a Zoom webinar.

To make these seminars as live as possible, and totally not like pre-recorded videos, we'll follow a "Questions and Answers" format. The lecture part will only last for about 20 minutes, and after it we'll switch to Q&A (AmA) with the speaker, where you should ask questions, and they would answer.

But as it is impossible to explain a project in 20 minutes, all speakers will share some reading with us ahead of time. We will need to read it before the seminar, not to look like complete noobs.

Finally, to help you find willpower to read the readings, I'll ask you to submit a short response to it ever week.

## Tools

We'll be using:

* **Slack** to communicate about the course, share files, etc. üõë Or should I use something else?
* **Google forms** to collect your responses to assigned reading before each meeting.
* **Zoom webinars** for actual meetings.
* **Email** for emergency notifications, or personal questions.

Before classes even start, make sure to:

* **update Zoom to the latest version** (go to https://zoom.us/download, download and install the latest version). This is important, as old versions don't support all features that we will be using.
* **Make sure your email and names are set correction on Zoom**. Go to Zoom website (https://zoom.us/) log in, go to `My Account`,  `Profile`.
* Make sure you have your full name on Zoom; the **name that you want people to actually use** (especially if it differs from your legal name).
* Make sure you **put your Bard email on Zoom:**  on the `Profile` page, find `Sign-In Email`, click `Edit`, and put **your Bard email** there. The reason this is important: I will use these emails to automatically track **attendance** with Zoom logs. If you don't put your Bard email, I won't be able to recognize you in the log, and thus won't count this meeting for attendance.

## A typical week

1. About a week ahead of each seminar, the speaker will share a paper with us. Something to read, to get prepared.
2. üõë I stopped here for now.
3. I'll create a Slack channel for each seminar, on our Slack server, and I'll post this reading there. I'll ask you all to read it, and also learn a bit about the speaker, and then think of what we want to ask them!
4. I will also post a link to a one-question google form. To a get a credit for this session (to show that you did the reading and thought about it), please submit a reasonable honest question that you had after reading the reading on this google form. Please make sure to do it before the seminar starts, to guarantee that you come to the seminar prepared.
5. If you also want me to ask this question during the Q&A session with the speaker, please either post your question before 9 am on Thursday, or post it on Slack! Also, feel free to use Slack for "personal"-style questions, about speaker's career, plans, experiences, general life advice, or personal anecdotes!
   * ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the only point in this entire syllabus that is a tiny bit tricky. The google form response is to show that you did the reading, so it needs to be about the reading. The Slack questions may be personal :) On some weeks you may only post the "for-credit" question (GoogleForm), and not the "I'm actually interested in what you think"  (Slack) question; that's OK!
6. During the talk, you will have 3 ways to ask questions (given in order or preference):
   * Best: ask a question "in-person", with your own voice. Do to so, "raise a hand"; I will see it, and will temporarily promote you to a "Question asker". If you updated Zoom since Summer 2020, your camera won't turn on (and in fact you cannot turn your camera on even if you want to). If you haven't updated Zoom since prehistorical times of Spring 2020, it may turn your camera on. (So better, just update Zoom :)
   * If too shy, use the Zoom native Q&A functionality.
   * If Q&A doesn't work for some reason, you can also post a question on Slack; I will monitor it.

## Grading

The course is taken Pass / Fail. To get a pass, you need to submit 80% of "Reading reflections" and attend 80% of Zoom talks. Zoom attendance will be taken automatically, using Zoom logs (so please make sure that your @bard email is shown correctly on your profile, as Zoom logs are organized by email)

In practice, 80% of 14 seminars = 11, which means that you can miss up to 3 talks no questions asked. 

## Draft Schedule

The schedule is still a bit in flux, but it will be settled soon!
