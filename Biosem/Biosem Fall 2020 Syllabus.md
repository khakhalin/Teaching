# Biosem - Fall 2020 - Syllabus

Due to the pandemics, this semester the Biology Seminar will happen online (remotely), as a Zoom webinar.

To make these seminars different from Youtube videos, we'll follow a new format this year! The talk (lecture) part of each meeting will only last for about 20 minutes. Then we'll switch to a Q&A session with the speaker. You can ask questions in this Q&A session either via Slack (in which case they'll be voiced by the host), or with your own voice on Zoom (by raising a "virtual hand").

## A typical week

1. About a week ahead of each seminar, I will ask the speaker to share one paper with us. Something that we could read, to be prepared to their talk.
2. I'll create a separate Slack channel for each seminar, on our Slack server, and I'll post this reading there. I'll ask you all to read it, and also learn a bit about the speaker, and then think of what we want to ask them!
3. I will also post a link to a one-question google form. To a get a credit for this session (to show that you did the reading and thought about it), please submit a reasonable honest question that you had after reading the reading on this google form.
4. If you also want me to ask this question during the Q&A session with the speaker, please post it on Slack! For the Q&A, I will only use questions posted on Slack. If you have any "personal"-style questions, about their career, plans, experiences, general life advice, or personal anecdotes - please, also post them on Slack!
   * ⚠️ This is the only point in this entire syllabus that is a tiny bit tricky. The google form response is to show that you did the reading, so it needs to be about the reading. The Slack questions will be asked to the speaker, so you have to be honestly interested in the answer :) On some weeks you may only post the "for-credit" question, and not the "I'm actually interested" question. That's OK! And on some weeks, the "for-credit" question and the "Please ask her this" questions may be different! That's also OK!
5. During the talk, if you have any follow-up questions, please also post them on Slack. I will have Slack notifications appearing in the corner of my screen, and I'll keep an eye on them. Please don't spam with "lmao omg is it even real lol" during the talk, but other than that - please use this channel to communicate with the host :) 
6. Zoom native Q&A functionality will be disabled during the talk (it's not good enough for our purposes).
7. If you want to ask a question "in person" (with your own voice), please raise a virtual hand on Zoom :)

## Grading

The course is taken Pass / Fail. To get a pass, you need to submit 80% of "Reading reflections" and attend 80% of Zoom talks. Zoom attendance will be taken automatically, using Zoom logs (so please make sure that your @bard email is shown correctly on your profile, as Zoom logs are organized by email)

In practice, 80% of 14 seminars = 11, which means that you can miss up to 3 talks no questions asked. 

## Draft Schedule

The schedule is still a bit in flux, but it will be settled soon!
