# Biosem - Fall 2020 - Syllabus

Due to the pandemics, this semester the Biology Seminar will happen online (remotely), as a Zoom webinar.

To make these seminars different from Youtube videos, we'll follow a new format this year! The talk (lecture) part of each meeting will only last for about 20 minutes. Then we'll switch to a Q&A session with the speaker. You can ask questions in this Q&A session either via Slack (in which case they'll be voiced by the host), or with your own voice on Zoom (by raising a "virtual hand").

## A typical week

1. About a week ahead of each seminar, I will ask the speaker to share one paper with us. Something that we could read, to be prepared to their talk.
2. I'll create a separate Slack channel for each seminar, on our Slack server, and I'll post this reading there. I'll ask you all to read it, and also learn a bit about the speaker, and then think of what we want to ask them!
3. I will also post a link to a one-question google form. To a get a credit for this session (to show that you did the reading and thought about it), please submit a reasonable honest question that you had after reading the reading on this google form. Please make sure to do it before the seminar starts, to guarantee that you come to the seminar prepared.
4. If you also want me to ask this question during the Q&A session with the speaker, please either post your question before 9 am on Thursday, or post it on Slack! Also, feel free to use Slack for "personal"-style questions, about speaker's career, plans, experiences, general life advice, or personal anecdotes!
   * ⚠️ This is the only point in this entire syllabus that is a tiny bit tricky. The google form response is to show that you did the reading, so it needs to be about the reading. The Slack questions may be personal :) On some weeks you may only post the "for-credit" question (GoogleForm), and not the "I'm actually interested in what you think"  (Slack) question; that's OK!
5. During the talk, you will have 3 ways to ask questions (given in order or preference):
   * Best: ask a question "in-person", with your own voice. Do to so, "raise a hand"; I will see it, and will temporarily promote you to a "Question asker". If you updated Zoom since Summer 2020, your camera won't turn on (and in fact you cannot turn your camera on even if you want to). If you haven't updated Zoom since prehistorical times of Spring 2020, it may turn your camera on. (So better, just update Zoom :)
   * If too shy, use the Zoom native Q&A functionality.
   * If Q&A doesn't work for some reason, you can also post a question on Slack; I will monitor it.

## Grading

The course is taken Pass / Fail. To get a pass, you need to submit 80% of "Reading reflections" and attend 80% of Zoom talks. Zoom attendance will be taken automatically, using Zoom logs (so please make sure that your @bard email is shown correctly on your profile, as Zoom logs are organized by email)

In practice, 80% of 14 seminars = 11, which means that you can miss up to 3 talks no questions asked. 

## Draft Schedule

The schedule is still a bit in flux, but it will be settled soon!
