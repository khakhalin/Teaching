### Course description

In this course, we will learn to model, visualize, and analyze biological processes. If you are a biologist, you will learn to code in Python (using Jupyter notebooks), which is an important, empowering, and highly marketable skill. Throughout the semester, you will be working on two long projects, gradually building up their complexity, and improving your code. If you are a computer scientist or a mathematician, you will learn how to apply your computing skills to the analysis of scientific problems; how to use models to make conceptual predictions about the world, and describe these predictions in academic writing. The course will lead to a 4-week long individual project. Prerequisites: either BIO202 (Ecology and Evolution), or CMSC 201 (Data structures), or permission from the instructor.
