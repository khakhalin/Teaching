# Intro Neurobiology: Alternative Final Paper Assignment

*Version: Jan 2021*

Assignment description:

1. You need to send me 5 topics **that you really care about**. We need it to find a narrow topic for the paper, at the intersection between your interests, and neuroscience
2. I'll pick a topic for you; send it to you, and it will become a topic for your final paper.
3. You'll need to go on Google Scholar and find 4 papers: **2 primary papers** on this papers (aka research papers, with methods, results and everything), on this topic, and **2 reviews** to give you some context. (Pick only papers that you can access for free. But if worst comes to worst, there's also this Kazakhstani illegal site scihub, remember?)
   * If the topic is hot, I may ask you to use only papers published after 2010 or something like that. If the topic is very niche, we may have to look into older papers as well.
   * The research papers should be closely related to your topic, but reviews may of course be a bit more lax. Like, if we decide for you to write about neuroscience of language in left-handed people (just a random example), one review may be about neuroscience of language, and another review - about brain organization in left-handed people. While both research papers will be narrowly on topic.
4. Read these papers carefully.
5. Write a short essay (5 pages max, normal-spaced; so not more than 2000 words), informal, describing what you learned from these papers, how it relates to your interests, and what it all could mean. Don't just summarize the papers!! (that's boring!!). Sure, write a bit about them, but more importantly, put them in the context. Compare them to each other. White how what you learned from them relates to the bigger picture. Try to put it into the context of what we learned in this course. Relate it to bigger societal issues, or your personal interests, if you want to. Try to write a good informative essay. Maybe almost like something that could be published in a popular magazine about science. That's our target genre.
6. At the very end, add references to all 4 papers in the "References" section at the very end. (In Google Scholar, find this article, click on the "quotation mark" symbol, copy the citation in APA format). 
7. You are of course welcome to use other sources as well. If you can reference them, even better. But no pressure about the citation style; you may use end-notes, footnotes, or even just write about the papers, hoping that I'll figure out which one is which. If you can support your claims with references, that's great, but don't do it for the sake of making your text look "sciency"; that's not our goal here. Popular essay about science, remember?
8. Deadline for this assignment: 4th day of completion week.

## Inspirational links, to better get the genre

These links are obviously an overkill, as these are top-notch science outreach projects, but just in case; if you never read good popular articles about science before, find some, skim them, and get inspired.
