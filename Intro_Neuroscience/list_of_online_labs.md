# A list of ideas for remote labs

The list is heavily informed by discussions with [@AizenmanLab](https://twitter.com/AizenmanLab) :)

# Pandemics prevention

There is no simulation better suited for the moment than this network science simulation about preventing pandemics by targeted vaccinations:

http://vax.herokuapp.com/

It's a simple in-browser game, and an amazing one at that. As students do the "Tour" first (it will introduce them to some concepts of network science), and then play some games, starting at Easy difficulty and with network centrality highlighting on, then Medium, and with highlighting off.

The game is about vaccinations, so ask them to write a short reflection about how  this simulation applies to current situation with the Coronavirus, when vaccinations are not yet available.

# Cellular neuroscience

## Eyewire

This virtual lab will take about 2 hours of student's time; it's fun, and _realistic_ (in the sense that it shows some actual problems that actual scientists have to deal with). EyeWire is a project in which people created a game (!) to enroll humans to help computers to reconstruct neuronal connectivity in the retina. Please read this description first: https://blog.eyewire.org/about/ 

Then create an account, log in, and go through the tutorial: https://eyewire.org/signup 

Once done with the tutorial, analyze at least one real cube (better two). 

Post a screenshot of your cube once it is completed.

## Action potential simulators

### Simple spiking neuron simulator

https://ilearn.med.monash.edu.au/physiology/action-potentials

It has several sub-labs (click through the menu on top, then pick "Simulation").

### Phet 

Ionic channels simulation: 
https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/legacy/membrane-channels

Action potential simulation:
https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/neuron

I never quite used these simulations in practice, but they seem quite nice, and have guides for teachers. And by the way, there are lots of other simulations on the PHET web-site in the biology category; may be worth looking through them!
https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/category/biology

### Meta-neuron

Downloadable; on a fancier (almost biophysical) side of things. http://www.metaneuron.org/

## BrainU Virtual Neurons

http://brainu.org/lesson/virtual-neurons

A flash app that works in a browser (but because Adobe Flash is now considered obsolete, and is disabled by default, one has to click here and there to enable it). You can drag neurons around, connect them to each other, and create circuits. The site comes with 2-3 pre-written labs:

I never used it personally, as I found the design a bit clunky, but based on what I heard, it does work.

## Can you Cajal?

Invented by @AizenmanLab for his intro course. You find a really good high-res Golgi stain, like this one for example:

http://www.gigapan.com/gigapans/ce024d012dfe25bb0ad595b75f547262

You then ask students to imagine that they are a researcher of old who just prepared some Gogi stains. Can they draw a neuron based on these stains? Can they reconstruct a shape of a typical neuron? How, according to them, a neuron in this part of the brain looks?

Students should submit a photo of their drawing, and a paragraph describing how they approached this task, and what they think about this process.

# Circuits

## Neuronify

https://ovilab.net/neuronify/

This free program (aka app) with integrate-and-fire neurons works both on computers and phones, as is on a fancier side of things, but needs to be downloaded.

Apparently it comes with several important microcircuits pre-created, so one could ask students to study one of these circuits, document its behavior, etc. Read more about it [in the paper that accompanies the app]( https://www.eneuro.org/content/eneuro/4/2/ENEURO.0022-17.2017.full.pdf). Or you can ask students to _design_ a circuit of your choice! I couldn't find pre-packaged labs that would use it, but it feels that for a slightly more advanced course, they should be reasonably easy to create. Build a CPG? Make a startle escape circuit? Lateral inhibition? 

## Deep Learning as a source for Neuro-intuitions

http://playground.tensorflow.org/

This deep learning demo toy is awesome, and illustrates so many key points in neuroscience! If you teach neuro, make your students play with it! You can let them work in sandbox model (the above link), or you can ask them to go through a few exercises created by Google, with this link:

https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/introduction-to-neural-networks/playground-exercises

After they go through the exercises, make them reflect on the following points:

1. Why are we born with some many "extra" neurons that are eliminated immediately after birth through cellular competition and synaptic pruning? What's the point of it, computationally?
2. How come a fruitrly can do something with 3 neurons, where a vertebrates needs hundreds or even thousands to support the same function? Which is totally the case for visual navigation.

# Hearing and Sound

## Hearing curve

Build your own audiogram (a curve of hearing thresholds for different frequencies):

https://hearingtest.online/

Quite possibly, there may be better tools to build an audiogram online, and I just could not find them :) I think the idea is quite reasonable though. And in headphones, one can also compare their right ear to their left year, and figure if there is a difference.

You can pair it with this hearing loss simulation:
http://auditoryneuroscience.com/prosthetics/hearing-loss-simulator

## Tone masking

http://auditoryneuroscience.com/scene_analysis/masking_tone_noise

The text below the simulation basically sketch a short lab that can be build around it. Add a few extra questions, a short reflective write-up, and you have a lab.

And generally, the Auditory Neuroscience site ( http://auditoryneuroscience.com/ ) contains TONS of cool resources about hearing. Browse through them; maybe you'll find some more than can be easily turned into a lab?

## Musical tones

I am not sure how productive this lab is, as it kinda relies on the participants being at least somewhat musical, while at the same time somewhat ignorant. But you may give it a try. Ask students to start an oscillator at, say, 200 Hz:

https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/

Then ask them to open this same link in a different window. Keep 200 Hz in the first window constant, as a drone, but change the frequency of the second oscillator, trying to find pairs of frequencies that sound "good" (consonant?). Make students write these frequencies down.  Then reflect on what they have in common. Then compare it to some article (wikipedia?) about the structure of a musical scale. Then write a short reflective piece about it. Optionally, assign some stuff about just intonation, like [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NlI4No3s0M), for example.

## Spectrograms

Ask students to download a spectrogram app. (I use [this program](https://spectrogram.software.informer.com/16.0/) on my PC, but there are several nice free apps for both Android and iOS). Ask them to build spectrograms of various sounds? Ask them to post these spectrograms online to a shared space, and make other students guess on what sounds they may represent?

Or maybe start with them saying short English words, and asking other students to guess what words these could be? Maybe pre-precord some words, and give them a short list of "options", to trick them into reading these "possible words" to their spectrograms, and then comparing the spectrograms?

When I use spectrograms in my "normal classes", I link them to [Tuvan throat singing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2ovoRyv4kw), where we [try to learn it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zZainT9v6Q), while staring at spectrograms of our voices. But I'm not sure whether it is easy to transfer online.

# Vision

## Experiential micro-labs

Ask students to watch these videos, then run these labs at home.

- Floaters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKQT1MXfasM
- Saccades: https://vimeo.com/54546597

The only trick here is to come with a good write-up, or a good set of reflective questions, as the videos are awesome.

## Blind spot mapping

First read this description: https://coglab.cengage.com/labs/blind_spot.shtml

Essentially we are trying to do what this person in the picture is doing (the one with crab-like shapes):
http://nivea.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/FeelingSupplements/BlindSpotFillingInExperiments.htm

Then go to this funny green app and map your blind spot:
http://avtanski.net/projects/blindspot/

Ironically, the result it shows uses a green/red scheme, so it will be invisible to red/green colorblind people.

An alternative to this approach is to open Paint or some other standard build-in program, draw a target, stare at it with one eye, and use your mouse to move the cursor into the blind spot. When you cannot see it, click the mouse. By repeating this again and again you'll kinda map your blind spot. Upload the results. I tried it, it works, but I could never reproduce these "crab-like" structures from the article below. (I personally think it's a fantasy, but maybe students would think otherwise? :)

# Motor systems

QWOP game: try to make the runner run at least 10 m:

http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html

Post your personal record, and the reflection on your strategy. Was it hard? Was it easy? How come you can walk at all if controlling flexors and extensors is that hard?

# Perception

## Face attractiveness

http://faceresearch.org/demos/average

There is a [whole set of experiments](http://faceresearch.org/exp/) on this web-site, but I never tried them myself. A simple lab on facial attractiveness could involve selecting several faces, and making someone (a friend? a relative?) rate them on a 10-point basis. Then make them also rate a face that is an average of these three. Repeat several times (with different faces), make a nice figure with error-bars. 

Are average faces rated any different than real faces? (Spoiler alert: they are). From the evolutionary point of view, what could be the mechanism here? (Spoiler alert: it's unclear, and curiously it [doesn't seem to be related to symmetry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15376799). But there's lots of research on it. The question for the students would be mostly to probe their reasoning; we are not expecting a correct answer; we are expecting some good hypotheses.)

## Geometrize

http://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/geometrize-haxe-web/

Upload a picture; see it gradually appear on the screen. Every few seconds (use a timer?) note how pretty the picture is, on a 1-10 scale. Repeat with several pictures. Build the curve. When is the picture the pretties: in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end? Why? If possible, find a friend and subject them to the same procedure? Is their curve different from yours?

(A disclaimer: I don't know the answer to this "WHY". I'm thinking a lot about it myself, and I think it is research-worthy, but at the very least it's definitely a cool topic for a short essay!)

## Point-walker

http://www.biomotionlab.ca/Demos/BMLwalker.html

Change the settings of the point-walker; hide them from your screen, show the walker to a friend. Can they guess your settings?

# Development

http://recursivedrawing.com/

Recursive drawing, as a metaphor for complex systems, and complex structures emerging from simple rules.

Use this site to create a cool picture. Post a picture online, to the discussion board. Comment on two pictures posted by other students. Write a short reflection about how this assignment could possibly relate to brain development.

(Don't prime students; let them figure it out by themselves? They usually do, and many of them enjoy making these pictures.)

# Evolution and dynamic systems

## Introduction to scientific simulation

Two best simulations ever were both developed by Nicky Case:

* Parable of the Polygons: https://ncase.me/polygons/
* Evolution of trust: https://ncase.me/trust/

With either (or both), ask students to go through the entire story, then write a thoughtful response. Or questions. Or a proposal of how they would build further on this simulation if it become their research project. Like, what would have they added? Or some other questions you yourself had after going though it.

## Complexity Explorables

https://www.complexity-explorables.org/fields/biology/

Complexity explorables is my favorite collection of explorable simulations ever - they include percolation models, predator-prey, flocking, evolution, and many more. A good lab based on these simulations would probably involve parameter exploration

## Virtual evolution

First go through this demo: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/205807

Then play this game: https://keiwan.itch.io/evolution

Submit a screenshot of your critter and its record.

# Simplewriter 

This is not exactly a lab, but a cool assignment that I often use in my classes (once a semester, to spice things up a bit).

First, read this comic: https://xkcd.com/1133/ 

Then watch this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p_8gx-XHJo 
And also this page from "Things explainer": http://i.cbc.ca/1.3390492.1452021709!/fileImage/httpImage/thing-explainer.jpg

Then use this link to access the simple writer: https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/ 

As a homework, pick any topic we studied in this course so far. Anything about ions, action potentials, synapses, neurons, escape responses, animal models, sensory systems, hearing, vision, etc. Try to describe this topic using simple words only. (The SimpleWriter will alert you if your words are not simple enough) The *only* non-simple word you can use is the concept itself that you are trying to explain, and even that one you can only use thrice!

# MRI and fMRI

Here are some cool resources that, it feels, can be turned into labs rather easily (although I have never quite used them):

MRI browser: 
http://www.med.harvard.edu/aanlib/cases/caseNA/pb9.htm	

A meta-database that shows which part of the brain got activated in various fMRI studies, summarizing these studies by keyword: https://neurosynth.org/

For example, here's data for anger: https://neurosynth.org/analyses/terms/anger/

Send students on a hunt? Make them come up with a research program, use the second site as a "virtual fMRI", then the first site to explore the structures? Ask them to describe the results of their "study"?

# Other

Other cool resources that can probably be turned into nice labs.

* Allen brain atlas: http://celltypes.brain-map.org/
  Send students on a treasure-hunt-like quest? Make them find a cell type and write about it? idk.
* Database of cell morphologies: http://neuromorpho.org/

Some untested labs:

* Virtual biology labs from HHMI: 
  https://www.biointeractive.org/classroom-resources/transgenic-fly-virtual-lab
* Some fancy neuro-stimulator called SNAPP, with lots of potential labs, on a more numerical side of things:
  https://med.uth.edu/nba/snnap/snnap-models-and-examples/
* Some interactive resources on Serendig website:
  https://serendipstudio.org/bb/
