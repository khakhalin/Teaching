# Intro Neuro - Full list of Readings, Videos, and Extra Materials

*Version: 31 Jan 2021*

# Intro & Resting membrane potential

Dears, here are the homeworks for the first week. If you can do at least some of them by tomorrow (Tuesday), that would be awesome! And by Thursday, I expect you to do it all. I realize that it's weirdly a lot for the first week, especially considering that we have our 2nd class tomorrow, but that's a one-time thing. For the rest of the course, we'll have a bit less stuff, and with more time to prepare.

Videos:

* Intro lecture, Intro to this class (30 min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12SqDoBRyu8
* Week 1 lecture,  Resting membrane potential (1h): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hixcnsh0bhM
  * Note that these two lectures were not edited, so I recommend to listen to them at ~125-150% speed.

* Adam ruins everything, on water (5 min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWASUMMQjj8

Short self-guided lab-like activity:

- An interactive short story about neurons, synapses, and anxiety (with great narration, by amazing Nicky Case, who is an absolute hero of scientific outreach): Neurotic neurons: https://ncase.me/neurons/

Optional (don't post at this point):

- Khan academy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3ngsl7FhTc

Once you have read and watched all that, as a follow-up to this post (not as a new separate post, but below, in the "follow-up" section), submit a good honest question you have about these topics. Something that you did not quite completely understand yet, but that you thought was interesting. Something you would be interested in discussing in class. 2-3 sentences would do (but feel free to write 5-6 sentences if it helps to explain your point!)

And if anything is weird, doesn't work, etc. - please send me an email!

# Hearing week 2: Sounds in the brain

We have two very different topics this week. One is something that is maybe a bit more down to earth (sounds localization), but that we understand better. And then something that is really cool and interesting (speech and music) that we however don't understand that well.

### Simple Writer Assignment

- Read this comic: https://xkcd.com/1133/ 
- Watch this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p_8gx-XHJo 
- See page from "Things explainer": http://i.cbc.ca/1.3390492.1452021709!/fileImage/httpImage/thing-explainer.jpg
- Then use this link to access the simple writer: https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/ 
- As a homework, **pick any smart term or clever concept that we studied** in this course so far. Anything about from ions, action potentials, synapses, neurons, neurotransmitters, escape responses and behavior, animal models, and down to sensory systems, hearing, brain regions – anything that we studied. Pick one term. Then **try to write an encyclopedia entry for it using only simple words**! Describe the meaning of it, add some details, tell a story. (The SimpleWriter will alert you if your words are not simple enough). **Write a paragraph of text** (at least 150 words, but the better, the more, as it's freaking hard). Make sure it provides a good, detailed description. Go on tiny tangents if necessary (like they did in the youtube video), as it may help to set the picture right.
- Don't tell anyone what you were trying to describe! Other students will later read your description and try to guess what it was :)
- No two people may be describing the same term! (Unless the first description was so obscure that you couldn't guess it). It means that the first few participants will have it easier (they can pick simple things like "brain" or "neuron"), while later contributors will have to be a bit more creative. But we studied LOTS of fancy words in this course, so it should not be a problem ;)
- Good luck! And let me know if you have any questions!

### Visual labs to run at home

Make sure to do all of these exercises below. It should take about an hour, maybe 1:30 of your time tops (watching the videos, and then doing the exercises), and it's really, really worth it! 

1. Watch this video, and do everything they recommend (you'll need a piece of paper, a pencil, and a wall. You can also use a computer screen if you make it uniformly white, like by maximizing a white GoogleDoc document or something)
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_W-IXqoxHA 

2. Watch this video, and do everything they recommend (you'll have to go outside at some point, as you'll need to see the sky):
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKQT1MXfasM

3. Watch this video, think about it, and do the exercises (you'll need a mirror):
   https://vimeo.com/54546597 

4. Blind spot mapping:
   * Read this description: https://coglab.cengage.com/labs/blind_spot.shtml 
   * Then this page: http://nivea.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/FeelingSupplements/BlindSpotFillingInExperiments.htm
   * Finally, ran this lab: http://avtanski.net/projects/blindspot/ 
     (Ironically, the program uses a green/red color scheme, so it is invisible to red/green colorblind people. Yep. Sorry. One would think that a person writing an app about vision would know more about vision, but oh well). You may try it with 75 dots first, but then sit comfortably, closer your eye with your other hand, and do full 300 points. It will take about 5 minutes, but you can do it! Once done, screenshot the picture that you get (only the result, without any identifiable information), and post it on Piazza **anonymously**. (This is important for privacy reasons). There's no "right" or "wrong" pic here, and also different people will run this test slightly differently, as it's not a precise medical procedure, but still, it will be interesting to see several different results!

As a write-up for this lab, pick the exercise that you liked the most (that you found most interesting and informative), and write either a haiku, a sonnet, or a limerick about it. (Use Wikipedia to learn the rules of each genre, if unsure). Post it below!

  Watch some of their older videos (the older - the better; the recent ones are less useful). They talk in Dutch, so turn on English subtitles. Watch something like Ketamine, MDMA, N2O. Or something else. Note that personally I would have drawn the line earlier than they do (they try cocaine, amphetamines, and GABA agonists that I definitely do not endorse). Note also that they don't touch opiates. Also in some of the videos they go through all sorts of simple motor and cognitive tests, which is instructive (I wish they did it more).

- Practical assignment:
  - Geometrize: http://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/geometrize-haxe-web/
    Upload a picture; see it gradually appear on the screen. Every few seconds (use a timer?) note how pretty the picture is, on a 1-10 scale. Repeat with several pictures. Try to figure out, when the picture looks the prettiest: in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end? Why? If possible, find a friend and subject them to the same procedure; will their curve differ from yours?

  - Paranoid schizophrenia simulation (a questionable attempt to make a training video. I'm not sure it's good, but I'm not sure it's bad either.

# Morality

- The evolution of trust: an amazing interactive (!) simulation that explains how moral behavior is beneficial, how it can evolve, but also how immoral behaviors may be beneficial as well, and what defines the balance between the two, within a society, or a population: https://ncase.me/trust/
- A short 3 minute (for real!) video that describes how it applies to animal populations, and how (if you think of it) it is almost inevitable that a population would always have a sizable share (but always a minority!) of individuals who behave as assholes (sorry for a introducing this term here) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUxt--mMjwA
- Optional (but cool): a 15 min video on moral behaviors in animals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcJxRqTs5nk
- "The final 5%": a rather heart-breaking story about a case of traumatic brain injury in which a person mostly recovered (something they called a 95% recovery): https://longreads.com/2019/10/22/the-final-five-percent/
- And one more optional read: When your child is a psychopath (EDIT: I think it goes without saying, but this set of stories is also fascinating yet disturbing. If you are in a bad place right now, I will understand if you decide not to read it. But it not without hope, as you'll see if you read it till the end): https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/when-your-child-is-a-psychopath/524502/

1) Why some behaviors that we perceive as potentially moral or immoral can even develop evolutionary. Or maybe, a more pointed question would be, how could a feeling of moral and immoral develop evolutionary? Where did these concepts come from?

2) What are the mechanisms (brain regions, cognitive mechanisms etc.) behind the moral intuitions in humans? For example, how do they fail sometimes? Why do they fail? And how can we live with it?
