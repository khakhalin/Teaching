# Intro Neuro - Full list of Readings, Videos, and Other Materials

*Version: Feb 21, 2021*

# Intro & Resting membrane potential

Dears, here are the homeworks for the first week. If you can do at least some of them by tomorrow (Tuesday), that would be awesome! And by Thursday, I expect you to do it all. I realize that it's weirdly a lot for the first week, especially considering that we have our 2nd class tomorrow, but that's a one-time thing. For the rest of the course, we'll have a bit less stuff, and with more time to prepare.

Videos:

* Intro lecture, Intro to this class (30 min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12SqDoBRyu8
* Week 1 lecture,  Resting membrane potential (1h): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hixcnsh0bhM
  * Note that these two lectures were not edited, so I recommend to listen to them at ~125-150% speed.

* Adam ruins everything, on water (5 min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWASUMMQjj8

Short self-guided lab-like activity:

Once you have read and watched all that, as a follow-up to this post (not as a new separate post, but below, in the "follow-up" section), submit a good honest question you have about these topics. Something that you did not quite completely understand yet, but that you thought was interesting. Something you would be interested in discussing in class. 2-3 sentences would do (but feel free to write 5-6 sentences if it helps to explain your point!)

And if anything is weird, doesn't work, etc. - please send me an email!

# Excitatory synapse. Connectomics. Escape in shrimp. Free will

This week we need to learn about two very different questions, and think about one more:

1. How exactly are neurons connected to each other? Does the action potential just "jump" from one neuron to another, or is it something different?
2. Is it important which neurons are connected to which ones, or is it a random "free-for-all" everything to everything? Does the geometry of these connections matter? How can it support (produce) meaningful behaviors?
3. How do we feel about it, in terms of free will? Not necessarily at a deep philosophical level, but in terms of our intuitions? If a bunch of neurons are connected into a network, and it helps an animal to make decisions and behave in a certain way, what do we secretly expect, for it to register as "free will" for us?

As usual, once you have read the materials, and watched all the videos, as a follow-up to this post (below, in the "follow-up" section), submit a **good honest question** you have about these topics. Something that you did not quite completely understand yet, but that you thought was interesting, and that you would honestly like to potentially discuss in class. 2-3 sentences would do (but feel free to write 5-6 sentences if it helps to explain your point!)

## Lab: Eyewire (virtual)

Dears, this week the lab is virtual and self-guided: there's no required zoom call (although you are welcome to join me for officer hours; see below!). For the lab, you will go through it at your own pace. It's a really nice project, and if you have any questions about it as you go through it, please post them here, or email me, or find me on Zoom, or let me know in any other way!

So here's the plan:

1. First read the description: https://blog.eyewire.org/about/ 
2. Then create an account ( https://eyewire.org/signup ), log in.
3. Carefully go through the tutorial and the practice cubes. Make sure to get the controls right, especially how to switch the projections:
   https://blog.eyewire.org/getting-started-eyewire-keyboard-and-mouse-commands/  
4. Once you are fully done with the tutorial, analyze at least three real cubes.

Before submitting your last cube to Eyewire, make a screenshot of your screen, and post it below, in the thread. This will count towards your participation in this lab. You don't have to write a lab report, but I want to see a cube that is done well, with some effort 🙂

And honestly, it's a fun project. When I tried it the first time, I got carried away, and edited about 20 cubes or so, before I remembered to stop :) It gets addictive if you are into this sort of brainy things :)

The deadline to finish this lab and submit the results is Friday this week. But I suggest you try to do on Tuesday, because you have this time scheduled in your calendars, so you could as well use it :) It should take you slightly more than an hour to go through all exercises.

# Ethology. Inhibition. Integration

Dears, here's the homework for next week. Note that I post readings first, and lectures later, as I figured this sequence actually makes more sense. Read (or at least look through) the materials; get the terminology, and some main idea, but perhaps get a bit confused about the technical side of it, then watch the lectures; hopefully get it "click"...

Readings (note that we have two very different topics this week):

- Wikipedia article about Ethology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology
- Wikipedia article about Neuroethology: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroethology
  Make sure to look through the list of model systems at the bottom of this page. Figure out what was studied in each of these systems. Try to understand why this question (of all possible questions) was asked in this animal, and why this animal (of all possible animals) was used to answer this question?
- Synaptic transmission in the CNS: chapter 6: https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/s1/chapter06.html

- [Curious Behaviors, by Provine - a chapter about sneezing](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yw_tUCYVnfLC5wrxTAXwfSSBs8izDJiC) - chapter shared on Google Drive

Video lectures: 

* Neuroethology (50 min). This is the first edited lecture (with pauses trimmed out), so perhaps watch it at a normal speed? Or at least pause often. It's lots of information, and new concepts, so you need to stop and think about it every now and then, even if it feels like what I'm saying makes some sense: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ls9hVr7sbX0
* Synaptic integration (1h 10 min): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8okgr1EsPco

Advanced, optional:

- On dendritic computations: Hidden Computational Power Found in the Arms of Neurons. Jordana Cepelewicz. Jan 14 2020.
  https://www.quantamagazine.org/neural-dendrites-reveal-their-computational-power-20200114/
- [Animal Behavior by Scott, Chapter 1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bFO0KdDtnB99Fn9Im9I-YBxcB-4rCbZ0)  - chapter shared on Google Drive

As usual, once you have read the texts, and watched the videos, post below, in the thread, a good honest questions about something you would actually want to understand (and/or discuss in class), about any of these topics. If the question feels vague, or hard to formulate, please give me 1-2 sentences of background info, so that I could follow your logic :)

## Lab: Animal behavior (virtual)

Dears, this week we have a self-guided virtual lab again. The lab will consist of 3 parts: one about mice, and one about birds, and then the third one about the animal of your choice. In total, it will probably take about 60 minutes of your time. The goal for this exercise is to learn more about how animals behave, and also about how we can study these behaviors.

### 1. Rodent behavior

1. Click this link: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/r-dot-bains/rodent-little-brother-secret-lives-of-mice . Create an account and sign in (the link is in the top right corner).
2. Read the `Learn more` page about the project, then go through the training videos in the `Get started` section. In this section you can get through the "morning routines" of 3 mice: red, green, and blue. Click the first button (`Morning routine of Red Mouse`), read the tutorial (a tab `Tutorial` becomes available on the right, once you are on the page with the videos). Then go through each of the videos, answering questions in the form (is the mouse visible, is it asleep, what is it doing, etc.). Once done, return to the main page, and click on the similar tab for the `Green mouse`, and then for the `Blue`.
3. As of now (Feb 2021) the project is out of data, so you cannot actually go beyond the tutorial. I am guessing they probably got a certain number of independent assessments from different people on each mouse... So once you are done with the practice data, just go to the next exercise (Birds Nesting).

### 2. Bird nesting

1. Click this link: https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/spotteron/nestcams
2. Read all materials about the project, and the description of what they expect from us. Do the `Tutorial` part (there's a link near every video).
   * As you can see, this project is actively running right now (as of Jan 2021), so in this case we're not only learning new things, but contributing to actual research :)
3. Process at least 20 real videos. The interface in this project is a bit different, but you get to identify whether it's 1 bird or 2, and whether they are sitting or standing, and what do they do in this short video.

### 3. Free observation

1. Pick **one** of those videos (any species you like):
   1. 3 hours of Bees in a hive: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpZR1xDsQiw
   2. 1 hour of ants on an anthill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrBD-XpHm1o
   3. 1 hour of ants leaving and entering an underground colony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0MGSbZoVfs
   4. 12 hours of birds coming to a feeder: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foJ9L3Dsrpk
   5. 30 minutes of a penguin colony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6It83thrsQ0
   6. 11 hours video of a seagull colony: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4N4PyXioKs
   7. 3 hours of some random fish tank: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLMhVJlOb3E
   8. You can also find any similar video on Youtube - a long stable shot of a bunch of animals just doing their animal thing, in which case please post a link together with your writeup; I'll happily add more good videos to this list! But it shouldn't be a documentary, and it shouldn't be a CGI fish tank lol! (It's weird, but Youtube seems to have hundreds of videos that pretend to be fish tanks, but are actually obviously CGI screensavers. Don't fall for this; it is a trap!) Ideally, we want a long (>30 min) uncut single-shot video of animals just being themselves.
2. Pick a video, scroll to some random point, and observe for at least 5 minutes. Try to see whether this video can be used to ask a scientific question. Try to follow one animal. Try to note what the behavior of this animal consists of. If you were to quantify it, similarly to how it was done for birds and mice in two first exercises, what would your categories be? Which behaviors are frequent, which ones are infrequent?

### Write-up

1. Reflect on **what** you observed. Did this experience of looking at animal freely behaving change the way you imagine their life, so to say? Anything new that you learned about behavior of any animal in particular?
2. Reflect on **how** you observed. Did you learn anything new about how people study animal behavior? Was it easy to classify mice and bird videos? Was it easy to make some sense of "long-shots of animals just being there" videos? How did it go? What do you think?
3. As a follow-up to this post, below, write and post one short paragraph with any thoughts and responses to those 2 prompts above. 3-4 sentences would do. It's a loosely defined target, but I want some honest reflection and engagement. You don't need to sound smart, or write something profound, but I want some evidence of your actually honestly thinking about these questions.
4. On the odd chance that you interacted closely with both mice, birds, ants, and penguins before, and none of these videos taught you anything new, please just write about that. Describe something about relevant animal behavior that is important, but that these videos did not represent well.

Please make them "Unresolved"; I'll "Resolve" them as I read / answer them. Ideally, do it by Sunday 11 pm, but if it's impossible, then do it by Wednesday 11 pm. 

## Labs: Motor control and Being random

Dears, this week's labs are both virtual, and will take about an hour of your time. It's two simple games that both are almost impossible to win (sorry for that :)

**Part 1: Try to be random**

Please visit this link: https://www.expunctis.com/2019/03/07/Not-so-random.html 

Read the description, and play the game several times (every time just reload the page).

In short, if you manage to be unpredictable, you win. But if you behave similarly to how you have behaved in the past, you lose. Use arrow keys for "left" and "right", and watch the plot to track your "money". Play the game, and count how many clicks it takes you to lose your first 60 bucks (the moment when the balance of 940 becomes visible on the Y-axis for the first time as you start with 1000 virtual dollars in your pocket).

Try at least 2 different strategies. Which strategy worked better?

**Part 2: Try to be a CPG**

Visit this link: http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html 

Read the description. Then play the game.

Your goal for this lab it pass the 5 meters mark. (Not even 100 meters. Not even "run"). Just, in any way, dead or alive, pass the 5 meters mark :)

Suffer for at least 10 full minutes. Try different techniques. Then if everything fails, watch some youtube tutorials (easily findable). Then suffer some more. Try again and again, exploring different strategies, until you cross the 5 meters mark, or you have worked on it for 30 minutes straight, whichever comes first :)

**Writing response**

For each lab, write a paragraph, describing at least two different strategies that you tried in this lab, and how productive they were. Then meditate for 10 minutes, and add one more sentence, describing how it relates to our understanding of the brain, life, and ourselves ;)

Feel free to post screenshots to document your success (or the lack thereof haha, it's also fun :)

### Simple Writer Assignment

- Read this comic: https://xkcd.com/1133/ 
- Watch this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p_8gx-XHJo 
- See page from "Things explainer": http://i.cbc.ca/1.3390492.1452021709!/fileImage/httpImage/thing-explainer.jpg
- Then use this link to access the simple writer: https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/ 
- As a homework, **pick any smart term or clever concept that we studied** in this course so far. Anything about from ions, action potentials, synapses, neurons, neurotransmitters, escape responses and behavior, animal models, and down to sensory systems, hearing, brain regions – anything that we studied. Pick one term. Then **try to write an encyclopedia entry for it using only simple words**! Describe the meaning of it, add some details, tell a story. (The SimpleWriter will alert you if your words are not simple enough). **Write a paragraph of text** (at least 150 words, but the better, the more, as it's freaking hard). Make sure it provides a good, detailed description. Go on tiny tangents if necessary (like they did in the youtube video), as it may help to set the picture right.
- Don't tell anyone what you were trying to describe! Other students will later read your description and try to guess what it was :)
- No two people may be describing the same term! (Unless the first description was so obscure that you couldn't guess it). It means that the first few participants will have it easier (they can pick simple things like "brain" or "neuron"), while later contributors will have to be a bit more creative. But we studied LOTS of fancy words in this course, so it should not be a problem ;)
- Good luck! And let me know if you have any questions!

### Visual labs to run at home

Make sure to do all of these exercises below. It should take about an hour, maybe 1:30 of your time tops (watching the videos, and then doing the exercises), and it's really, really worth it! 

1. Watch this video, and do everything they recommend (you'll need a piece of paper, a pencil, and a wall. You can also use a computer screen if you make it uniformly white, like by maximizing a white GoogleDoc document or something)
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_W-IXqoxHA 

2. Watch this video, and do everything they recommend (you'll have to go outside at some point, as you'll need to see the sky):
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKQT1MXfasM

3. Watch this video, think about it, and do the exercises (you'll need a mirror):
   https://vimeo.com/54546597 

4. Blind spot mapping:
   * Read this description: https://coglab.cengage.com/labs/blind_spot.shtml 
   * Then this page: http://nivea.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/FeelingSupplements/BlindSpotFillingInExperiments.htm
   * Finally, ran this lab: http://avtanski.net/projects/blindspot/ 
     (Ironically, the program uses a green/red color scheme, so it is invisible to red/green colorblind people. Yep. Sorry. One would think that a person writing an app about vision would know more about vision, but oh well). You may try it with 75 dots first, but then sit comfortably, closer your eye with your other hand, and do full 300 points. It will take about 5 minutes, but you can do it! Once done, screenshot the picture that you get (only the result, without any identifiable information), and post it on Piazza **anonymously**. (This is important for privacy reasons). There's no "right" or "wrong" pic here, and also different people will run this test slightly differently, as it's not a precise medical procedure, but still, it will be interesting to see several different results!

As a write-up for this lab, pick the exercise that you liked the most (that you found most interesting and informative), and write either a haiku, a sonnet, or a limerick about it. (Use Wikipedia to learn the rules of each genre, if unsure). Post it below!

Risky links:

- Drugslab channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvRQKXtIGcK1yEnQ4Te8hWQ/videos?flow=grid&view=0&sort=da
  Watch some of their older videos (the older - the better; the recent ones are less useful). They talk in Dutch, so turn on English subtitles. Watch something like Ketamine, MDMA, N2O. Or something else. Note that personally I would have drawn the line earlier than they do (they try cocaine, amphetamines, and GABA agonists that I definitely do not endorse). Note also that they don't touch opiates. Also in some of the videos they go through all sorts of simple motor and cognitive tests, which is instructive (I wish they did it more).

# Executive control, Morality, and Creativity

## Frontal regions

Please start with these general readings:

* First try to skim this (it's hard, so don't get discouraged, just read it for 10 minutes): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_lobe
* Then listen to this metaphorical explanation from Robert Sapolsky (4 minutes): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RRtyV_UFJ8
  * Except that the Marshmallow test he describes at the very end was actually debunked 2-3 years ago (we can talk about it in class if you remind me. And that's the overall problem with Sapolsky's courses - they are absolutely brilliant, but not entirely true, as quite a few of the most striking and imaginative experiments he describes failed to completely replicate)
* Finally, read about lobotomies, and try to understand why they worked: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobotomy

## Morality

Some questions to think about: 

* 1) Why would (or maybe "How could") a feeling of moral and immoral actions and behaviors develop evolutionary? Where did these concepts come from? What's the point of having them, in terms of survival?
* 2) Overall are moral behaviors (broadly speaking) good for animals, in terms of helping their survival? Or is it more beneficial for animals to act "immorally"? (whatever it means?)
* 3) What are the mechanisms (brain regions, cognitive mechanisms etc.) behind the moral intuitions in humans? How can they fail? And how can we live with it?

Now some videos and readings:

- The evolution of trust: an amazing interactive (!) simulation that explains how moral behavior is beneficial, how it can evolve, but also how immoral behaviors may be beneficial as well, and what defines the balance between the two, within a society, or a population: https://ncase.me/trust/
- A short 3 minute (for real!) video that describes how it applies to animal populations, and how (if you think of it) it is almost inevitable that a population would always have a sizable share (but always a minority!) of individuals who behave as assholes (sorry for a introducing this term here) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUxt--mMjwA
- "The final 5%": a rather heart-breaking story about a case of traumatic brain injury in which a person mostly recovered (something they called a 95% recovery): https://longreads.com/2019/10/22/the-final-five-percent/
- Optional (but cool): a 15 min video on moral behaviors in animals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcJxRqTs5nk
- And one more optional read: When your child is a psychopath (EDIT: I think it goes without saying, but this set of stories is also fascinating yet disturbing. If you are in a bad place right now, I will understand if you decide not to read it. But it not without hope, as you'll see if you read it till the end): https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/when-your-child-is-a-psychopath/524502/

## Beauty and Creativity

  - Another article that claims that actually creativity, as measured objectively, is decreased in FTD patients (only read the abstract, you definitely don't have to read it in-depth): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20868703

And some optional readings. Only do them if you have time, and are interested in creativity, visual arts, etc:

  - And also [this interview with him](https://skepticalinquirer.org/2013/05/oliver-sacks-on-hallucinations/) - it provides a bit more background, and also mentions synesthesia, which is another interesting phenomenon (look it up if you haven’t heard about it!). 
  - You may also want to glance through this wiki article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aura_(symptom)
- Aphantasia: a phenomenon that was discovered only very recently, IN A BLOG POST! Like, for real! 
  - Here's the original post:

  - Can a person with aphantasia be a visual artist? It appears there’s no correlation whatsoever: https://twitter.com/ianmcque/status/1226246492148715520

Potential practical assignment:

- Geometrize: http://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/geometrize-haxe-web/
  Upload a picture; see it gradually appear on the screen. Every few seconds (use a timer?) note how pretty the picture is, on a 1-10 scale. Repeat with several pictures. Try to figure out, when the picture looks the prettiest: in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end? Why? If possible, find a friend and subject them to the same procedure; will their curve differ from yours?
