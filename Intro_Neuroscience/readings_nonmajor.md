As taught in Spring 2020.

# Pain

- The agony of feeling no pain: https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18713585

  NYT times version, may be behind paywall: [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/magazine/ashlyn-blocker-feels-no-pain.html 
  ](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/magazine/ashlyn-blocker-feels-no-pain.html)A [pdf copy of this article (without pics, but with all the text)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VeEikLsKIirjxQT9DWj0xpqWZaPsJXzZ)

- How pain relievers work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mcuIc5O-DE

Once you have read and watched all that, as a **follow-up to this post** (not as a new post, but below, in the "follow-up" section), submit a **good honest question** you have about these topics. Something that you thought was interesting, but that you did not quite completely understand yet. Something we could potentially discuss in class, if we have time. 2-3 sentences would do (but feel free to write 5-6 sentences if it helps to explain your point!)

Please submit anonymously, and please have it done by 9 am on Thursday, so that I could read your questions before the class.

# Neurons and action potentials

* Action potential mechanisms: http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/ap.html
* Action potential, conceptual visualization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90cj4NX87Yk
* Death by coconut (TODO add link here)
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWASUMMQjj8 - Adam ruins everything, about water (something we discussed last week)
* Neurotic Neurons: https://ncase.me/neurons/

After reading the texts, and thinking about them, please post below, anonymously, as a follow-up to this post, one (or max, two) good questions. Some genuine question that you had as you read these text; something that seems interesting, and that you'd like to understand, but that you could not quite completely get. Perhaps something that would be fun to discuss in class.

Note that if a question can be answered with a 20-sec Google search it doesn't count :) We are not asking questions for the sake of just asking something; I want to know what you actually think, and also I want to have some fuel for our class discussions. OK?

  ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xk_Gml5C-i46QICTvmEDOHeGIT_DDoJL)It's a longish paper, so first look through it, then pick a 2-3 subtitles to your interest, and read them. I'm OK with the idea that each of you would read a slightly different part of it, but I want you to try to read at least 2-3 pages that seem most relevant to you.

- A video on just intonation (roughly speaking, Baroque tuning, or pre-modern Western scale): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NlI4No3s0M

- Different scales and musics. Listen to them, try to hear whether the scale is different from a "Western scale". Try go get the aesthetics of each of these styles; try to guess what features of it may be most valued by the listeners.

  - http://auditoryneuroscience.com/scene-analysis/continuity-illusion
  - http://auditoryneuroscience.com/pitch/missing-fundamentals

As usual, post your thoughts below, and try to frame them as a good question. Not necessarily a question that can be answered easily, but one that could lead to an interesting exploration. Make sure not to go for a one-liner, but explore and explain your thinking

# Vision

- Use wikipedia (or google?) to read a bit about the following terms: eye, retina (including rods, cones, fovea, and blind spot), lens, pupil. Understand how early steps of vision work, and how we perceive color.
- Then watch some videos:
- - Micro-labs (please actually try them at home!)
  - - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKQT1MXfasM
    - https://vimeo.com/54546597
  - "This is not yellow" (only watch the first third, ignore the rest, it’s irrelevant):

  - https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140905-the-women-with-super-human-vision

Once you feel that you kinda have some idea of what is going on in the eye, and how the eye communicates with the brain, please write below, as a follow-up to this post, what you would actually like to discuss in class. As usual, please provide at least some background and context; some of your thoughts, and where you think this discussion might go. It would be better if you could frame the topic as a question.

# Vision 2

  Explore the settings. Try different walkers. Remove the lines, work only with the dots. Cover some part of the screen, show the walking figure to your friend: will they be able to tell if it's supposed to be a happier, sadder, heavier, lighter, feminine, masculine person etc? Will they be able to guess the choices you made about the walker?

  - Upload a picture; see it gradually appear on the screen. Every few seconds take a mental note of whether the picture looks pretty, on a 1-10 scale. Repeat with several pictures. In your opinion, when does the picture looks the prettiest: in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end? Why? Does it tell us anything about the nature of beauty; of what we perceive as beauty?

# Memory (incomplete)

  - Cecilia’s life with schizophrenia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7csXfSRXmZ0
  - Schizophrenia simulation (warning: it may be scary, and also of course it's a bit of a cartoonish caricature. Some people hate it and argue that it is "problematic". I think it's useful in a way, but take it with a mug of salt): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWYwckFrksg
  - Some old educational videos of patients with schizophrenia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWaFqw8XnpA

# Morality

1) Why some behaviors that we perceive as potentially moral or immoral can even develop evolutionary. Or maybe, a more pointed question would be, how could a feeling of moral and immoral develop evolutionary? Where did these concepts come from?

2) What are the mechanisms (brain regions, cognitive mechanisms etc.) behind the moral intuitions in humans? For example, how do they fail sometimes? Why do they fail? And how can we live with it?

Here are some materials, first more about the first question, and then more about the second:

- The evolution of trust: an amazing interactive (!) simulation that explains how moral behavior is beneficial, how it can evolve, but also how immoral behaviors may be beneficial as well, and what defines the balance between the two, within a society, or a population: https://ncase.me/trust/
- A short 3 minute (for real!) video that describes how it applies to animal populations, and how (if you think of it) it is almost inevitable that a population would always have a sizable share (but always a minority!) of individuals who behave as assholes (sorry for a introducing this term here) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUxt--mMjwA
- Optional (but cool): a 15 min video on moral behaviors in animals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcJxRqTs5nk
- "The final 5%": a rather heart-breaking story about a case of traumatic brain injury in which a person mostly recovered (something they called a 95% recovery): https://longreads.com/2019/10/22/the-final-five-percent/
- And one more optional read: When your child is a psychopath (EDIT: I think it goes without saying, but this set of stories is also fascinating yet disturbing. If you are in a bad place right now, I will understand if you decide not to read it. But it not without hope, as you'll see if you read it till the end): https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/when-your-child-is-a-psychopath/524502/

# Final projects

**What is the format for final projects?** - It can be either a short essay, or anything creative themed around brain and cognition; ideally about topics we discussed in class. Like, if you make a visual art that somehow is part a visual illusion, or a musical piece that messes with formant perception, it's also fine. But a short essay is the default form.

**How long should this essay be?** - I'd rather it is short and not long, you know, as I want other students to read it, not just me. And if it is too long, most people won't have the patience. I'm thinking that 2-3 pages could be enough to write a punchy piece? But we are not going after length. We want something as short as possible that still does the job. Like when you are writing for a newspaper or an article; you never have the goal in characters; you have a hard upper limit, and it never feels like enough space.

**How to find a topic?** - For topics, you have several options:

- you can write about an interesting scientific study (anything really). One option could be to go to https://scholar.google.com/ , and put there some interesting search terms. Like "cat emotions", or "elephant LSD", or "zombie snail", or "brain prosthetics";
- or you can think of any recent controversy related to brain and cognition: any topic that was divisive in the press and social media
- or an interesting neurological or psychiatric medical condition (in which case try to understand and write a bit about the underlying biology),
- or an interesting animal with a seemingly unorthodox neuroscience (what they feel, how they act, and what could it mean for their inner workings, and their cognition)

And whatever you pick, let's talk about it first (in the comments below). Just to make sure this topic is writable. I can also help with finding some materials, if you realize that you struggle.

**When are the deadlines?** - The deadlines, or rather target dates, will go as the following:

- Come up with some idea for a project: this Monday, **Apr 20**
- Finalized topic, OKed by me: Friday, **Apr 26**
- Submission: Mon, **May 11**
- Super-short 2-3 min presentation in class: Thursday, **May 14**

**How will it be** **submitted?** - Here on Piazza, as a pdf file (unless you want to post it on your blog or instagram or something like that, in which case submit a link). Let's make it visible to everyone in class, as I hope we'll read each other's projects.

**How will it be graded?** - You have a "pass" by default. If you do a project, you'll get something between "A" (for a good project), and "B" (for a weak one). A good project introduces the topic, relies on some sources (it should be clear from the project that you did some background work), and is overall interesting to read. Our target style is scientific journalism. Our role models are people like [Carl Zimmer](https://carlzimmer.com/), [Ed Yong](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/ed-yong/), [Bethany Brookshire](https://bethanybrookshire.com/), [Katie Mack](http://www.astrokatie.com/), or [Kelly Clancy](http://www.kellybclancy.com/). Except that we aren't going for a long form. We want short form, yet grounded in evidence - both in terms of science, and in terms of opinions around science.

**Should we use in-text citations?** - No, a list of references in the end would be enough. Or footnotes, if you prefer footnotes. Or direct links if you're writing more in a blog format.
