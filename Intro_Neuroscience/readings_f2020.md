Risky links:

- Drugslab channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvRQKXtIGcK1yEnQ4Te8hWQ/videos?flow=grid&view=0&sort=da
  Watch some of their older videos (the older - the better; the recent ones are less useful). They talk in Dutch, so turn on English subtitles. Watch something like Ketamine, MDMA, N2O. Or something else. Note that personally I would have drawn the line earlier than they do (they try cocaine, amphetamines, and GABA agonists that I definitely do not endorse). Note also that they don't touch opiates. Also in some of the videos they go through all sorts of simple motor and cognitive tests, which is instructive (I wish they did it more).

  - A doctor and fentanyl: https://torontolife.com/city/crime/doctor-perfect-life-got-hooked-fentanyl/
