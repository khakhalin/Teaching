### Simple Writer Assignment

- Read this comic: https://xkcd.com/1133/ 
- Watch this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p_8gx-XHJo 
- See page from "Things explainer": http://i.cbc.ca/1.3390492.1452021709!/fileImage/httpImage/thing-explainer.jpg
- Then use this link to access the simple writer: https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/ 
- As a homework, **pick any smart term or clever concept that we studied** in this course so far. Anything about from ions, action potentials, synapses, neurons, neurotransmitters, escape responses and behavior, animal models, and down to sensory systems, hearing, brain regions – anything that we studied. Pick one term. Then **try to write an encyclopedia entry for it using only simple words**! Describe the meaning of it, add some details, tell a story. (The SimpleWriter will alert you if your words are not simple enough). **Write a paragraph of text** (at least 150 words, but the better, the more, as it's freaking hard). Make sure it provides a good, detailed description. Go on tiny tangents if necessary (like they did in the youtube video), as it may help to set the picture right.
- Don't tell anyone what you were trying to describe! Other students will later read your description and try to guess what it was :)
- No two people may be describing the same term! (Unless the first description was so obscure that you couldn't guess it). It means that the first few participants will have it easier (they can pick simple things like "brain" or "neuron"), while later contributors will have to be a bit more creative. But we studied LOTS of fancy words in this course, so it should not be a problem ;)
- Good luck! And let me know if you have any questions!

### Visual labs to run at home

Make sure to do all of these exercises below. It should take about an hour, maybe 1:30 of your time tops (watching the videos, and then doing the exercises), and it's really, really worth it! 

1. Watch this video, and do everything they recommend (you'll need a piece of paper, a pencil, and a wall. You can also use a computer screen if you make it uniformly white, like by maximizing a white GoogleDoc document or something)
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_W-IXqoxHA 

2. Watch this video, and do everything they recommend (you'll have to go outside at some point, as you'll need to see the sky):
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKQT1MXfasM

3. Watch this video, think about it, and do the exercises (you'll need a mirror):
   https://vimeo.com/54546597 

4. Blind spot mapping:
   * Read this description: https://coglab.cengage.com/labs/blind_spot.shtml 
   * Then this page: http://nivea.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/FeelingSupplements/BlindSpotFillingInExperiments.htm
   * Finally, ran this lab: http://avtanski.net/projects/blindspot/ 
     (Ironically, the program uses a green/red color scheme, so it is invisible to red/green colorblind people. Yep.)

As a write-up for this lab, pick the exercise that you liked the most (that you found most interesting and informative), and write either a haiku, a sonnet, or a limerick about it. (Use Wikipedia to learn the rules of each genre, if unsure). Post it below!

  Watch some of their older videos (the older - the better; the recent ones are less useful). They talk in Dutch, so turn on English subtitles. Watch something like Ketamine, MDMA, N2O. Or something else. Note that personally I would have drawn the line earlier than they do (they try cocaine, amphetamines, and GABA agonists that I definitely do not endorse). Note also that they don't touch opiates. Also in some of the videos they go through all sorts of simple motor and cognitive tests, which is instructive (I wish they did it more).
