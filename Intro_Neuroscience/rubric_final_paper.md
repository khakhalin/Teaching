# Intro Neurobiology: the Rubric for the Final Paper

Neil Geiman once wrote (I'm paraphrasing): when people tell you that something in your writing doesn't work, they are usually right. When they tell you how to fix it, they are usually wrong. 

Let's approach peer-reviewing with this in mind. The rubric is below, but except for the first 3 criteria, that are about getting the format right, let's just tell each other about the parts that didn't quite work for us. Let's also give each other advice on how to fix it, but, you know, take this advice with a grain of salt. Just let's try to be kind :)

Also remember that if a sentence is horrible, we can either find better words, fix the grammar, and make it work, or we can remove it altogether, and maybe write something else instead. Not everything is worth saving. Some vague sentences, for example, may be vague not because they lack details, but because they are not really necessary.

So, here's how a good paper should look like:

1. The paper starts with a **reference** to the original paper (name, authors), followed by an http link
2. The **length** is reasonable (not more than 5 pages single-spaced, with ~11 font size)
3. All **7 parts** (paragraphs) are there (perhaps with subtitles?): 1 Background, 2 Why this paper, 3 Question and hypothesis, 4 Methods, 5 Figures, 6 Answer, 7 Limitations.
4. The writing is **clear**, concise, and to the point, as opposed to confusing or verbose.
5. The writing is **active**, as opposed to dead and formal. We don't like passive voice. We also don't like "smart" Latin words ("utilize, ascertain, demonstrate") where English words would be enough ("use, find, show).
6. The writing is **specific**, as opposed to vague, or missing crucial details.
7. If there are **abbreviations** **and fancy terms** in the text, they are explained at first use.
8. Now paragraph by paragraph:
   1. After reading this paragraph, we understand why this topic matters (either for science, or for the humanity as a whole), and why someone would study it at all.
   2. "Why did you pick this paper" - this one is personal, so as long as it reads well, it's fine :)
   3. The narrow question of the paper (the tiny step in the quest for knowledge that the authors decided to take) is explained. We can see what possible answers to this questions were even on the table. Like, what were the options? The range of possibilities? What we could have found? Is it clear now?
   4. The key method used in the paper is explained (if there's more than one key method; explaining one is enough). If it's very fancy, we get at least the basic idea behind it. Ideally, it would be nice to know what alternative methods were there, and how does the chosen method compare to the alternatives, but it's a harder question, so if this comparison is missing, it's ok. Make sure to check that the method described here is really the key method of the paper; not just the "first" method they used, or the one that felt easier.
   5. There's a rough run-down of what each figure does. Maybe one figure introduces the method, another one proves that it works, yet another shows the main result, and so on. For most figures, there's one sentence tops; maybe even half a sentence, but we get the outline of the overall logic of the paper (or rather, the logic of its visual presentation). If the paper is short, maybe one figure is discussed a bit more in-depth. But this section is still only one paragraph, about half a page, not more! (For example, we definitely don't need a boring list of what each figure shows! We want a rough guide, a few-sentences summary, not an accounting notebook!)
   6. We know how authors answered their main question (from paragraph 3), and what this answer means in a broader picture (in terms of paragraph 1).
   7. Did the writer honestly share their concerns about the paper? If they just said that "more experiments were needed", or if they wrote something about "human factor", it doesn't really count. That's not specific enough, and thus not helpful. Same, if they just stated that they don't think some results are convincing, without explaining _why_ they think so, it also doesn't count. But if they explained why they didn't like some parts of the paper, and especially if they have a nuanced opinion over how a paper could have been improved, that's great! That's the hardest question of all 7 though, so be gentle :)

# The logistics

## Before the peer-review session (due Thursday, Dec 03, 1 pm)

1. Please **save your paper as a Google Doc**, on your personal Google Drive.  Make sure it looks good (according to the rubric above), make sure it has your name, states the name of the paper you wrote about, and contains an http link to this paper.
2. Then go to the top right corner, click `Share` button, 
3. use the lower half of the dialog that says `Get link`, and click on `Change to anyone with the link`... thing at the bottom.
4. The dialog will change, and by default it would say "Anyone with the link... Anyone on the Internet with this link can view". And it will say `Viewer` on a sorta drop-down button on the right. Click this `Viewer` button and change it to `Commenter`.
5. Now the dialog will say "Anyone with the link can comment". Press the button `Copy link` a bit higher. A tiny pop-up should say "Link copied".
6. Now go on Piazza. As a *not-anonymous* (this time only) comment to this message, post your link.

## During the peer-review session

* Based on the topics of your chosen papers, I will pre-arrange you into groups of three
* Once everybody join, I'll send you into "breakout rooms" for about 5 minutes, to briefly introduce your papers to each other, and tell each other what sort of feedback you are looking for.
* Then we'll get together, and we'll start working silently (while on Zoom). Each of you will have 2 papers to review. You will read the first one for 15 min, then I'll tell you "Hey it's time to start reading the other one", and you'll switch to another one.
  * You have three options here. Either you read and take notes on a piece of paper, then read them aloud during the feedback session (see below)
  * Or you put some comments right in the text (the doc will be shared in the "people with a link can comment" mode). To add a comment, select a small piece of text (a word, a sentence), and add a "plus bubble icon" of sorts that appears on the right side of the screen, right across from this piece of text. Or right-click, and pick "add comment" in the menu. Note also, that once you've typed your comment, you need to press a button "Comment" there in the bubble; it's like a "Submit" or "Send" button in social networks; before you click it, you comment isn't saved.
  * Or you can type your comments in a separate document, then send them to the person. Either way would work, but please do take some notes.
  * If, while reviewing, you have any questions, send me a private chat on Zoom.
* After 30 minutes having read both papers, I will send you to break-out rooms again. Now you will give a 5-minute long feedback about each of the papers you read. And when you are receiving the feedback, please take some notes (for you privately; these won't be shared).
  * 5 minutes per paper per reviewer doesn't sound like a lot, but think of it: Alice, Bob, and Cathy would have read each other's papers. During the feedback stage, Bob will tell Alice his feedback (5 minutes), then Cathy will tell Alice her feedback (another 5 min), so 10 min total. Then same for Bob (also 10 minutes). Then same for Cathy (also 10 minutes). Even with 5 minutes per paper per reviewers, it will take 30 minutes.
  * If during the discussion you have any questions, call me to your breakout room.
* Once this is done, we'll convene again, congratulate each other with (almost) finishing the course, and part our ways :) As you can see, the session will last for about 1 hour 30 minutes: 5 minutes for everyone to connect, 5 minutes for me to manually assign you into rooms, 5 minutes for you to briefly introduce your projects, and to share expectations, 30 min for reading, 30 minutes for sharing feedbacks, and 5 min to close it off. Plus 10 min to resolve any issues if we have any technical difficulties.

## After the peer-review session

* I will also provide my feedback for each of your papers, but I'll do it over the weekend Dec 5-6, in order not to bias peer-reviewers.
* **By morning Dec 5 you need to do one more thing.** Go to your Google Doc, click on `Share` again, but this time use the top part of the dialog (`Share with people and groups`). Add my email (khakhalin@gmail.com) as a person to share the document with, and make sure I am added as the `Editor` (I think that's the default setting)
* Then I'll go and add comment, same as the other two reviewers. Why do I need to be the "Editor" then? The Editor role will give me access to `File / Version history`  for your document, and that's useful, as once you submit the final version of the paper, I'll be able to see all changes you did between the draft version and the final version. It will make grading easier, and also it will make sure that my assessment is more consistent. Like, if I recommended some change, and you did it well, that's good!
* After you get all 3 reviews in (2 peer-reviews, and 1 review from the instructor), you will revise your papers. The evening of **Friday Dec 11 will be the deadline for having the final version there**. As the link to the Google Doc will still be valid, you won't even have to resubmit anything; I'll just visit your Google Docs once again, and see how you have progressed. Just make sure you work with the same GoogleDoc, and not with some copy. Edit right there please (so that I could use the "Version history" feature).
* While revising the paper into its final form, if possible, don't "Resolve" my comments. There will be a button at every comment saying "Resolve", but if you press it, the comment will disappear. Ideally, I'd like them to remain in place, so that I could compare your edits with my comments. But if one or two disappear, just because you remove this sentence, or word, or whatever, that's fine, they'll still be accessible in the "Commenting history" menu.
* If I have any questions about your work, after you submit the final version, I'll reach out to you during the completion week (after Dec 11), and ask for a short (~10 min) 1:1 Zoom call, to talk about the paper. In the past, I usually did it for all papers, but I physically won't be able to do it for all papers this time around, so I'll do it only if it feels necessary.

If you have any questions, let me know!
