# Class plans (sketches) for the Intro Neuro class

# Intro & Resting membrane potential

### Session 1

syllabus + basic neuronal shape

### Session 2

Cell: what are DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids. What do these terms mean? What is the relationship between them? If you ever learned that, try to recall what you learned; if you never learned that, Google together as a team, and try to come up with a rough description of what's going on.

>We want to come up with a list of key players in this drama, and get some basic idea about their relationships, who is the boss, who likes whom etc. We (humans) have a really robust system for keeping track of social interactions between players, and all professionals (mathematicians, physicists, chemists) actually use them to learn stuff. It's not necessarily about personification, but about a useful metaphor, and developing an intuition.

More keywords (as a group, figure out what they mean): charge, ion, concentration, membrane, channel, potential.

### Session 3

ðŸ’¡ Quiz: Parts of a neuron + what neuron

K and Na - what are they?

Diffusion - what is it, and how does it happen? How quick is it? If we used diffusion to pass chemical bodies around within our bodies, how long would it have taken? Give a real-life example that illustrates the speed of diffusion (some example when diffusion happens, and where you can actually see its consequences).

Q: So where this voltage across the membrane is coming from? What equilibrium are we talking about? Equilibrium of what with what? And where does it come from?

Pivoting to questions

> ðŸŸ¢ If you want to learn, read my answers to other questions as well, not only to yours! As we go further, there will be cool tangents there, I'm sure!

# Action potential and Pain

### Session 1

>  ðŸŸ¢ A side-comment: I sensed some confusion in some of the faces last time, as ... but we need to strike a balance between talking about lofty topics and some nuts-and bolts. As if we abandon the hard mechanistic science altogether, and jump to the philosophy of mind, or so, we will loose all rooting, and I won't be able to even hint at one certain things are true, or not true, or possible, or impossible. So we have to juggle these two aspects of the course - the "facts and their understanding" (like, how things work), with "what it all means", and "what the implications are".  We'll keep doing that! And if you have any feedback or concerns at any point, please reach out and let me know!

Assignment about the permeable membrane (KCl on one side, NaCl on the other...)

Live drawing on the whiteboard of where K wants to go (as an answer for Quiz 1).

Quiz about ions

### Session 2

>  ðŸŸ¢ I use some emojis when responding to questions. Fire and Gem are basically the same, for cool questions. Lightbulb is for myself, to remember to address it. A warning sign will appear when I didn't like the question very much. Note that neither fire nor gem is a real "grade", as some questions just happen to be about topics that are exciting, or relevant for the course. So it's a combination of the quality of a question, and a lottery, about which questions I can actually answer. A warning side is however a warning that questions like that won't count in the future. You don't need to write a lot, but you need to write well enough for me to understand you.

Follow-ups on water video (start with questions that were asked): 

* so, summarize the problem here? Why too much water is dangerous?
* why are people in the States are obsessed with hydration? Where did it come from?
* Can you trust a scientific field that was wrong once?
* How can a scientific field become "mistaken"? Where untrue statements are coming from?
* Which areas of science are the safest, in terms of pseudoscience? Which areas of science are the most infested with lies?
* But then, how can an "ordinary person" from the street figure out what is true, and what is not? The claims by Gatorade and co sound so sciency, "electrolytes", and what not. Potassium! Ions! Real world is not usually about "Science vs superstition", it's about two sets of claims that can appropriate each others lingo, but that disagree. How to figure out who is right?

> Among possible answers: Do you know how they call an alternative medicine that works? Medicine.
>
> Or, that an ability to change one's mind is a sign of strength. A sound process of discovering the truth should have a strong built-in mechanism for changing one's mind. Like reversals on salty food in nutrition science. Or don't even get me started on fat and sugar.

Quiz about AP

### AP lab

https://ilearn.med.monash.edu.au/physiology/action-potentials

It has several sub-labs (click through the menu on top, then pick "Simulation"):

1. **Action potential** - find minimal current that evokes an action potential. Why is there a minimal current? 
2. Refractory period - perhaps skip (this topic seems to be simple for students)
3. **Stimulus strength** - how does the number of spikes change, as the current injected into the neuron increases? Can we say something else? How does is change, what would be the shape of this curve if you were to plot it? As we keep increasing the current, how does the number of APs change? Why? 
4. **Adaptation** - just try it, and try go guess, what the word "Adaptation" mean?  What could be the mechanism? Now, is it because neurons are weak? Or could it actually be useful one way or another?

### Session 3 - Pain

ðŸ’Ž Why pain exists? What does it signal?

Do these entities feel pain? How do you know?

* Your roommate
* A stone
* Candleflame
* A dog
* A horsefly
* An autonomous robotic mobile garbage collector.
* Those blue blobby things that live on a purple planet, with some crystals inside, tiny tubes, feeding on starlight or whatnot? They move around and build primitive starships when we first discover them.

Is the quality of pain experienced by a cockroach and a dog similar or different? Who is more in pain? Why?

If you have two animal species, one that lives 30 years and can heal, and another one that lives for a week, lays eggs, and dies; would you expect the "evolutionary optimal" responses to pain in these species to be similar? Why?

> Examples with autotomy, octopuses.

Two definitions of pain:

1. noniception (reporting of damage), 
2. processing and changes in behavior (that to us often "registers" as subjective perception, related to emotions)

ðŸ”¥ Now, guess how ethical research in animals works. What we can do, what we cannot do, which things are a "gray zone" and need to be argued and justified? Which things are "more OK", which things are "less OK"? Can we formulate a maxim of some chief principles to guide ethical research in animals? (We assume that some research is important, as we want to help humans who have diseases and traumas)

So, with this in mind, can autonomous robots feel pain?

* Tangent: What about human babies? (Long controversial history here that you can look up. But babies are slightly different, as we give them a cart-blanche for being humans)

How does tetrodotoxin work? Can it be used for analgesia; to block pain during surgeries or something? Why?

What can we infer from the fact that some people don't feel pain, but have all other tactile senses (touch, heat, etc.) What does it mean? What can we guess from this fact, in terms of how our bodies are "constructed"?

Why different people have different pain thresholds? Does pain threshold change in a human (in you) during your normal day-to-day activities? What may change it?

Say, you want to record from a brain of a live pigeon, using electrodes. I'll give you a hint: there are 3 ways to do it that are considered "OK"; any other option is not "OK". Guess these three options that you have?

# Synapse, Terminology, Free Will

## Session 1

refresher QUIZ: "Simple action potential"

*A discussion about pain (above).*

## Eyewire lab

Dears, this week the lab is virtual and self-guided: we won't be sitting together on Zoom; you will go through it at your own pace. It's a really nice project, and if you have any questions about it as you go through it, please let me know, or post them here, or email me, or join the office hours Zoom to ask them!

So here's the plan:

1. First read the description: [https://blog.eyewire.org/about/ ](https://blog.eyewire.org/about/)
2. Then create an account, log in.
3. Carefully go through the tutorial. Make sure to get the controls right, especially how to switch the projections:
   https://blog.eyewire.org/getting-started-eyewire-keyboard-and-mouse-commands/ 
4. Once you are fully done with the tutorial, analyze **at least three real cubes**.

Before submitting your last cube to eyewire, **make a screenshot of your screen, and post it below, in the thread**. This will count towards your participation in this lab. You don't have to write a lab report, but I want to see a cube that is done well, with some effort ðŸ™‚

And honestly, it's a fun project. When I tried it the first time, I got carried away, and edited about 20 cubes or so, just because I forgot to stop :) It gets addictive if you are into this sort of brainy things :)

## Session 2 - free will

QUIZ: Basic synapse

Why electric and chemical synapses exist?

Why metabotropic receptors exist?

What will happen if you make neurotransmitters stay longer in the synaptic cleft? In particular, what will happen if we do it:

* To all acetylcholine in the body?
* To all serotonin in the brain? (That's what SSRIs do...)

*Maybe: quickly revisit pain and robots.* 

* Where we ended is that the majority vote was that most animals, and maybe even plants, do some sort of pain signaling (reporting damage), but react to it differently (some "suffer", in the sense of changing their behavior to more passive / protective, until they heal, while some don't). But we didn't have time to talk about robots or aliens. So, if a roach feel pain, and then you make a robot with a wire for every neuron, and an appropriate tiny gadget for every synapse, reporting damage to robotic limbs and making robot withdraw from harmful objects... Would you say that this robot feels pain?

Let's briefly talk about free will now. Do these objects have free will?

* Your roommate
* A stone
* A candleflame
* A dog
* A cockroach
* An autonomous robotic mobile garbage collector.
* A blue blobby starlight-feeding alien on a planet far away

How do you know? How would you define free will? Does your definition match your intuitions? Is your definition falsifiable? (Do you have a procedure to "test" an active object for the presence of free will?)

# Ethology. Inhibition. Synaptic integration

## Pep talk

> Hey people, so I'd like to start with some general remarks. Thank for to everyone who voted in the poll last week, about the state of the course! As you may have noticed, there's a bit of bimodal distribution with two peaks; 25 students seem to like the course either a lot, or somewhat, while 21 are still o the fence about it. Now in 2-3 weeks I can run another poll, and see how the level of confusion changed :)
>
> But that said, I framed the poll as if being confused about something is the opposite of liking something, but of course it doesn't actually apply to learning. In general, being confused is fine. Like, look, *of course* if you never really read and thought about ions or lipids or what not before, of course it will be confusing! It's like a whole new world. It's like as if I told you your first sentence in Hungarian, or started talking about the differences between the black hats and yellow hats schools of Lamaism. Of course it's confusing! You never heard about it before! It's normal! The question is what do we do with it. Do we figure things out? Or do we give up?
>
> And because this course is optional, and passing it depends on your interest and honest work, and not on meeting some arbitrary proficiency criteria, all I ask from you is essentially some goodwill. Some interest, and enthusiasm. Some optimism. If you remember, I even sent you this letter back in December, trying to make you commit to trying things out! If you want to understand something, please help me to hep you! If you don't get something, if you are confused, ask questions! Come to office hours! Post questions on Piazza! Ask follow-ups! Engage with these topics!
>
> There's only one thing really that makes me seriously upset about teaching, and that's when people say that they do understand anything at all, and then *don't ask any questions about the topics of the lecture*; either on Piazza, on Zoom, or during office hours. Like, this just makes my brain short-circuit. Like, I understand people who want to learn and work in this direction. I also understand people who don't want to learn, but are happy about it; it's their decision. But when people both don't do the work (and asking questions IS work!), but also are not dropping the class, that's just confuses the heck out of me.
>
> So let me say that. If you, if some of you, don't want to deal with some particular topic, by all means skip it, concentrate on something else that's available that week. But please, don't spread this negativity around, this passive attitude of "I didn't get it, but I'm not gonna ask questions about it, I'll just be bitter", you know? It's not helpful, to you, and to others, and it's not kind to your peers. I accepted everyone who applied for this course, instead of only accepting graduating seniors, as the administration requested, because I thought it's an online course, so it may be my only chance to get in all people who are actually enthusiastic, and want to think about the weirdness of this world in safety, without the pressure of a grade. And the majority of people, if I look through the questions that you post, and if I look at your faces on Zoom, are really great, and enthusiastic, and are obviously treating these topics the same way as I hoped you would: as a confusing weird world of cells and neurotransmitters and spikes and what not! In which we are dropped, as it happens in the beginning of a fantasy book, you know? Where for the first few chapters you don't even know for sure whether these guys that the book tells you about are human or not, and whether there's magic, and whether dragons exist in this world, and like who the heck is Yennifer. Stuff like that. But gradually we figure things out. *That's* the spirit I hope to have here!
>
> But when people complain that the videos they need to watch at home are too long, which had not happened in this class yet, but sometimes it does happen, all I can do when it happens is to remind of this basic calculation from the syllabus. A working week is 40 hours. Full load is 4 courses, meaning that you study 10 hours for a course. Some 4 hours on average we spend in class, which means that 6 hours you do at home. Two of them are videos. Yes! The remaining 4 are reading, labs, and writing. Are there classes at Bard that you can pass without any homework? Sure. Is it a good use of your time, and perhaps money? Nope. It the class doesn't make you work, it means that you're short-changed. It means the prof doesn't do their fair share of work. Maybe they are old. Maybe something else. But the normal speed of growth is the one you get with about 10 hours per class per week.
>
> (And by the way, do readings first, then watch the videos. It works better that way!) 
>
> And don't get me wrong; I'm not saying that you should just shut up, read the textbook, and stay happy all the time.  That's what happens in big state schools in Canada. Please speak up, please ask questions! I'm always grateful for feedback, and I'm always trying to improve! But please make a few steps in my direction ok? Meet me half-way, or at least quarter-way, tenth of a way, but help me to help you! You are in this course by your own choice, and you know that many students who took my classes before learned from them, and were mostly on the happy side, or I would have been fired by now, which implies that (first) it is possible to learn this stuff, it's not magic, it's actually learnable; and (second) there's some logic to my method. These assignments, questions, tangents, videos, labs aren't random. They are all hints to something. Not all things are easy to "explain"; some we just need to get used to. So please try to get from this course as much as you can, and as much as you need! And help me to help you! OK?
>
> So thanks again for voting in the poll, and let's revisit this question in about 2-3 weeks, and see whether things start to click by then, and combine into one picture. OK?

## Session 1: Ethology

ðŸ’¡ QUIZ: Locations (the one with 4 options)

"Define Fixed Action Pattern"
like, in practice, how would you know that something is a Fixed Action Pattern? Imagine you're on an island. And there's a population of purple 6-legged lizards on this island. You have a year to study them. How will you know that something they do deserves to be called a Fixed Action Pattern?

Come up with a list of behaviors in that seem to satisfy the definition of a fixed action pattern:

* In squirrels (?)
* In cats
* In dogs (?)

"This squid is scared"
1) Can we say it at all? Would this statement make any sense?
2) What would it mean if we agree that sometimes we can say it? Like what would we mean when we say that an animal is scared?

## Session 2: Synapse and integration

ðŸ’¡ QUIZ: Transmitters

ðŸ’¡ QUIZ: Inhibitory synapse (bubbles)

ðŸ’Ž *Prepping for next week:*

* Some fixed action patterns involve a periodic sequence of events, like a periodic motion, or a bunch of periodic motions. Next week we will talk about networks that can support these periodic motions; these networks even have a special name: Central Pattern Generators, as they generate a pattern (that is repeated again and again), and are controlling it centrally, from the nervous system. So, let's try to to list some stable behaviors, some fixed action patterns, that involve a very repetitive periodic motion?
* *(first collect some in a large group, to set the tone, then maybe send to small groups)*

# Small networks. CPGs. Escape in fish

QUIZ: 

If you watched a lecture about CPGs, I do this thing there where I ask you to think about all other behaviors that can be mediated by CPGs, and then I give some answers. So even tho I gave those answers, let's do it again here now. In groups, create a list of all behaviors that are mediated by a CPG (or at least look as if they could be mediated by one?) Try to come up with new examples!

ðŸ’Ž *Prepping for next week:*

* Try to list as many senses as you can. Both human senses, but also ones that other non-human animals use.
  You already mentioned: sight, taste, smell. hearing, and touch. Expand the list! :)

# Neural Coding

1) Match the names to the codes
2) So, what would be the upsides and downsides of each coding system? When (where?) would you expect to find them in the brain?

Make wild guesses about what systems in the brain could be most likely to use temporal and phase codes

# Chemical Senses

> Given that different sensations can signify danger why have we come to enjoy sensations that previously could indicate something that could kill us like tasting bitterness for instance?

Also briefly comment that it's dangerously short.

> After watching last two lectures, I am thinking about how our senses "decay" after repeated long-term stimulation. For example, when we get into a room that stinks, in the beginning we might feel disgusted. But, after a while, we won't notice this smell anymore. So, is it our neurons that gradually get tired to transfer this information to the brain? Or does the threshold for detecting the smell increase? Or do we somehow "get used to the smell"?

> You also discussed how when a receptor is used it gets stronger, like strengthening a muscle, over time and reversely when a receptor isnâ€™t utilized it weakens and eventually dies out. 

This statement above is only half-true. Please discuss, 1) what is true in it, 2) what is not, 3) how to fix it? How to change it, to make it better reflect the reality of how our brains work?

> As for reasons to why we have a second nostril, could another reason be that we have a second nostril as backup for if the other nostril is clogged? Personally, when I am sick only one nostril gets stuffy and I'm able to catch a little breath through the other nostril that's not clogged and my mouth, so I don't know I was just curious if that could be another reason for why we have pairs of body parts.

**End:** be ready for the lab, have a ruler and some two-pointy device (like a compass, a well-controlled clip, or something like that)

# Hearing

* Why do we have earwax?
* Why with hearing loss, the sensitivity to higher frequencies is lost first? (Believe me, you can answer this one using your common sense)
* What makes different parts of the cochlea tuned to different frequencies, and how does cochlea work, in general?
* How do cochlear implants work?
  * Three sub-questions:
    How do they work?
    Why do they sound so weird? (Based on the examples you heard in the video)
    How come people still manage to use them, and function, if they are so weird?
  * https://auditoryneuroscience.com/prosthetics/noise-vocoded-speech
  * https://auditoryneuroscience.com/prosthetics/music
* Some people are very sensitive to loud noises. While others may be fine in a loud room or with music turned up high, this actually hurts their ears. What do you think could be the mechanism here?
* How des tinnitus work?
* Also when I think of ears I think of acupuncture and how certain parts of the ear connect to certain parts of the body. 
* I also think because I blast music and attended many concerts with loud music that I have probably damaged my hearing. Could one undo this damage?  

# Scientific ecosystem workshop

tbc

write info

write workshop:

* How does peer-review work?
* Find a good paper (GoogleScholar)
* Anatomy of a paper
* The financial side (Publishers, OpenAccess, SciHub)
* Scientific hierarchies

# Vision 1

* Draw an eye, what's in the eye - discuss
* Draw together, discuss
* Structure of the retina
  * What photoreceptors are there?
  * What's the difference between them? (Rods vs Cones)
  * What is rod spectral sensitivity? Why?
  * What are peak sensitivities for cones? What colors are each of the cones most sensitive for?
  * Why? What does it mean? Come up with some hypotheses, from the common sense pov.

# Vision 2

* A comment on the methodology of questions
* Next Wednesday, if there's civil unrest, we may use the class as a therapy session - we'll see, and play it by ear. I'll keep you posted; please check Piazza for updates.
* Postpone one topic? (Shift everything by a week?)
* Self-labs this Friday
* paper

You might have heard that the image in the eye is upside down somehow, and that the brain (that's what they say) needs to "learn" to turn it rightside-up...
Is it hard for the brain to learn that the image on the retina is flipped, and how would it look like of somebody's brain failed to "learn it"?
And I guess how do you feel about this statement in general?

My question is about night vision- why does it take your eyes time to react to the dark? Why do people say that dusk is the most dangerous time to drive in terms of your vision being impaired? why are cats able to see in the dark so much better than other animals?

1) What do we know about dark vision?
2) Why doesn't kick in instantaneously?
3) How long does it take?
4) What ruins it / preserves it? Why?
5) Guess why some animals (cats, owls?) have better night vision?



I understand to a degree how sight works when our eyes are open, but I am wondering why we see flashes of color when we close our eyes?



Also when we dream, what we see has nothing to do with what our eyes are doing right? I know once in REM our eyes move to follow our actions, but where are the images coming from?

As light gets brighter we are pulled out of sleep, so are we still processing everything around us while we are sleeping?



Also for people with Synesthesia, are their eyes telling them that they are seeing something that theyâ€™re not or does it skip the eyes and only happen in the brain? Would their eyes dilate if they see something in their mind that would normally make eyes dilate?



Though it's not yet possible, what would happen to the processing of color if someone had an eye transplant? Since we seem to all see colors in slightly different shades, would the person receiving the eye transplant notice a slight difference in the shades of colors (of an object they're familiar with)? I guess this comes down to exactly where these differences in perception come from. 



I have a question about laser eye surgery. By my understanding LASIK is pretty much reshaping the cornea using a laser. However, I'm wondering if "reshaping" the cornea has any harmful effects. The main article quotes "laser surgery is the most common treatment for the wet form but has the disadvantage of destroying normal retinal cells. It also may not be effective in preventing cell proliferation following treatment". So does this mean LASIK doesn't last forever and someone will eventually have to get it again? What happens if normal retinal cells are destroyed through LASIK?

In class, we were talking about how in old age people's vision often gets worse because their lens gets less flexible so it is harder for them to see objects closer up, but why do some people have a far-sighted vision? Is it most common to have issues with the lens or are there other factors?



The frogs were able to detect prey depending on the shape, movement, and number of a figure(s). Obviously these shapes weren't actually food, but the mere suggestion of it being prey because of the factors just mentioned, made the frogs think potential food was around. So I wonder what is the threshold or breaking point before the frogs no longer perceive the figures as food...But I am more curious about this in humans. In one of the attached videos a man showed different images that weren't the actual figure but provided enough essential elements, such as color and vague dimension, that we could perceive them as we know typically of them: for example the legos as different characters such as teenage mutant ninja turtles. What is our threshold before something is no longer perceptible? Is there even a way to measure such a response?

Motion aftereffect:

* Weaker but easier to understand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dupz1mmwpQU
* Stronger, but harder to tease apart: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkRHN0rnfME&t=20s

Your goal is to watch the video, then discuss with other people what happened, they discuss how the video probably worked, then discuss what could it mean for how our brain work. Like, what had happened?

1) Share what you see, try to find the logic
2) What could it mean? A hint: it's a consequence of a cool process that's "running in the background" when you see, but in this case it's getting a bit faulty. What could it be about?

## Vision 3

On papers and final projects:

* Sometimes I approve letters with reservations (like, it's technical, but if you like it - feel free to write about it). These are also "confirmations" that this paper is OK, so if you want to write about it, feel free to. Just be careful. However, if after some more deliberation, you decide to change the paper of your choice, that's also fine. Just respond to my response with a new idea, and mark this conversation as "unresolved" again, so that I would come back to it.
* When working with papers, make sure to read the correspondence between the author and the reviewers. Read what the reviewers disliked, and how the author responded. This is a unique thing about elife journal (no other journal publishes reviews, which is really a shame). So please read them: it will tell you a lot about the paper; it will make it easier to write a good overview of it, but also you'll learn a lot about how science works!
* The principle of self-calibration: I don't want you to reach the same level of proficiency with each of these papers; I want you to put a similar amount of effort, and learn a similar amount of stuff. So if a paper is long and super-weird, it is OK to understand the gist of it, and then understand one figure / method / approach / section in detail. If the paper is short however, or feels particularly accessible, I'll expect you to understand it better. So it's not about picking a harder paper or a simpler paper; strategically. It doesn't matter, ultimately. What matters is that you learn something new, and then tell me about it in a meaningful form ;)

1) Within your group, summarize the toad vision experiments (from those videos you watched). How does this whole worm / antiworm thing works?
2) If you were to summarize the results of this study to a philosophy student, what would you say? What is one take-home message from these experiments, in terms of "how the brain (or world) work"?
3) Are these behaviors, and this type of perception, innate or learned, in frogs?
4) Do humans have anything similar? Obviously, we learn to recognize our family, squirrels, and letters. But is there anything that may be at least somewhat remotely related to these behaviors in toads? Think about humans, and make a guess!!

## Vision 4

* When astronauts are in space and they go to sleep, many of them experience seeing sparks when their eyes are closed. I've heard this is from the amount of radiation in space, but how does the eye actually see these sparks if their eyes are closed. Astronauts always say its because of "radiation" but I'd love to know if you have any knowledge on this topic as well.
* We talked about green/m cones being what we use to determine shadows. Do we have an evolutionary explanation for this? Why green cones? And does this vary between different species? Are there other species that use different cones to best recognize shadow?
* I am interested in what you mentioned about how we can record activation directly from a retina if it is removed from an animal, and spread on a dish. What are some of the benefits and negatives of this approach? It seems like you can get a more focused result because you've eliminated all outside functions of the animal that might interfere with your recordings. I also assume this is a fairly difficult procedure to accomplish, with many areas of possible mistake. Do we lose any important information about the functioning of the retina when we view it in this way?
* In the first lecture it was mentioned that men tend to, overall, have a greater percentage of color blindness compared to women. You also said that the most common color blindness in men is red and green. Later in the lecture it was mentioned that specific species have more red cones in order to see berries. So my question is, evolutionarily speaking, is it possible that women have less color blindness because they were gathers while the men were hunters? Women had to use their detailed vision to locate vibrant berries (red and green in color) while the men needed vision for shapes of moving animals rather than small berries. Perhaps this is also why women tend to have better memory; having to remember where the most fruitful bushels were located.
* Are there people born without specific ganglion cells/can ganglion cells be injured? I would assume so. What affect does that have on the person or creature and can GC be repaired? What happens if you donâ€™t have the coordinate ones for instance? 

# Methods

QUIZ: Locations reminder (the one with goldfish, followed by ultrasound)

Methods of research in the brain (brainstorm, follow with slides)

Slides from the morphology lecture: 

* look at some pics, 
* recognize and name areas, 
* discuss what they do (quick and dirty associations)

Why fore-mid-and-hindbrain regions are called that way? What's the secret here?

Remember the videos you watched, and the stuff you read, about how orientation-selective cells in the primary visual cortex work.

In the retina we have this: (pic)

But in V1 (primary visual cortex) we have this: (pic)

**THE QUESTION:** How to get from cells with receptive fields like in the retina (top pic) to those like in the cortex (bottom pic)? How do you connect stuff to get orientation selective cells?



Q: I know we have been talking a lot about illusions that people have made to trick our sight, but what examples are there of illusions occurring in the natural world? We discussed how trains make you see movement even after youâ€™re done traveling, but what about animals or plants or any naturally occurring illusions? Are there any creatures that have evolved to create illusions to help themselves? 

# Cortex

Quiz on brain regions (7-8 min, not 5 - it takes them some time)

Cortex:

* draw a brain
* locate primary cortices
* Locate in-betweens
  * Figure out the planning one
  * the spatial one
  * the language one
* Explain memory
* Language areas
  * Draw a typical path of connections for listening
  * For responding an email
* What about the right hemisphere?
  * prosody music
  * you caught a human in whom both hemispheres are heavily involved in language processing. What can you guess about him? (5 min)
* Differences between hemispheres
  * ask them to list what they heard, but also sort it into 3 buckets: seems right; probably an exaggeration; probably a myth (5 min)
  * debrief

# Language

1. How is Wernicke's aphasia different from Broca's?
2. Where are the Wernicke's and Broca's areas in the brain?
3. Can we see any logic in where they are located, that could help us to remember their role?

What have you ever heard about the differences between the left and right hemispheres, and what's your opinion about these statements? (Which sound like true, and which ones are fishy?)



Imagine that you ran a person through an fMRI (or fancy EEG) study, and realized that BOTH sides of their brain are really involved with language. What guesses can you make about this person?
