# Class plans (sketches) for the Intro Neuro class

# Intro & Resting membrane potential

## Class 1

syllabus + basic neuronal shape

## Class 2

Cell: what are DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids. What do these terms mean? What is the relationship between them? If you ever learned that, try to recall what you learned; if you never learned that, Google together as a team, and try to come up with a rough description of what's going on.

>We want to come up with a list of key players in this drama, and get some basic idea about their relationships, who is the boss, who likes whom etc. We (humans) have a really robust system for keeping track of social interactions between players, and all professionals (mathematicians, physicists, chemists) actually use them to learn stuff. It's not necessarily about personification, but about a useful metaphor, and developing an intuition.

More keywords (as a group, figure out what they mean): charge, ion, concentration, membrane, channel, potential.

## Class 3

💡 Quiz: Parts of a neuron + what neuron

K and Na - what are they?

Diffusion - what is it, and how does it happen? How quick is it? If we used diffusion to pass chemical bodies around within our bodies, how long would it have taken? Give a real-life example that illustrates the speed of diffusion (some example when diffusion happens, and where you can actually see its consequences).

Q: So where this voltage across the membrane is coming from? What equilibrium are we talking about? Equilibrium of what with what? And where does it come from?

Pivoting to questions

> 👉 If you want to learn, read my answers to other questions as well, not only to yours! As we go further, there will be cool tangents there, I'm sure!

# Action potential and Pain

## Class 1

>  👉 A side-comment: I sensed some confusion in some of the faces last time, as ... but we need to strike a balance between talking about lofty topics and some nuts-and bolts. As if we abandon the hard mechanistic science altogether, and jump to the philosophy of mind, or so, we will loose all rooting, and I won't be able to even hint at one certain things are true, or not true, or possible, or impossible. So we have to juggle these two aspects of the course - the "facts and their understanding" (like, how things work), with "what it all means", and "what the implications are".  We'll keep doing that! And if you have any feedback or concerns at any point, please reach out and let me know!

Assignment about the permeable membrane (KCl on one side, NaCl on the other...)

Live drawing on the whiteboard of where K wants to go (as an answer for Quiz 1).

Quiz about ions

## Class 2

>  👉  I use some emojis when responding to questions. Fire and Gem are basically the same, for cool questions. Lightbulb is for myself, to remember to address it. A warning sign will appear when I didn't like the question very much. Note that neither fire nor gem is a real "grade", as some questions just happen to be about topics that are exciting, or relevant for the course. So it's a combination of the quality of a question, and a lottery, about which questions I can actually answer. A warning side is however a warning that questions like that won't count in the future. You don't need to write a lot, but you need to write well enough for me to understand you.

Follow-ups on water video (start with questions that were asked): 

* so, summarize the problem here? Why too much water is dangerous?
* why are people in the States are obsessed with hydration? Where did it come from?
* Can you trust a scientific field that was wrong once?
* How can a scientific field become "mistaken"? Where untrue statements are coming from?
* Which areas of science are the safest, in terms of pseudoscience? Which areas of science are the most infested with lies?
* But then, how can an "ordinary person" from the street figure out what is true, and what is not? The claims by Gatorade and co sound so sciency, "electrolytes", and what not. Potassium! Ions! Real world is not usually about "Science vs superstition", it's about two sets of claims that can appropriate each others lingo, but that disagree. How to figure out who is right?

> Among possible answers: Do you know how they call an alternative medicine that works? Medicine.
>
> Or, that an ability to change one's mind is a sign of strength. A sound process of discovering the truth should have a strong built-in mechanism for changing one's mind. Like reversals on salty food in nutrition science. Or don't even get me started on fat and sugar.

Quiz about AP

## Lab: AP

https://ilearn.med.monash.edu.au/physiology/action-potentials

It has several sub-labs (click through the menu on top, then pick "Simulation"):

1. **Action potential** - find minimal current that evokes an action potential. Why is there a minimal current? 
2. Refractory period - perhaps skip (this topic seems to be simple for students)
3. **Stimulus strength** - how does the number of spikes change, as the current injected into the neuron increases? Can we say something else? How does is change, what would be the shape of this curve if you were to plot it? As we keep increasing the current, how does the number of APs change? Why? 
4. **Adaptation** - just try it, and try go guess, what the word "Adaptation" mean?  What could be the mechanism? Now, is it because neurons are weak? Or could it actually be useful one way or another?

## Class 3: Pain

💎 Why pain exists? What does it signal?

Do these entities feel pain? How do you know?

* Your roommate
* A stone
* Candleflame
* A dog
* A horsefly
* An autonomous robotic mobile garbage collector.
* Those blue blobby things that live on a purple planet, with some crystals inside, tiny tubes, feeding on starlight or whatnot? They move around and build primitive starships when we first discover them.

Is the quality of pain experienced by a cockroach and a dog similar or different? Who is more in pain? Why?

If you have two animal species, one that lives 30 years and can heal, and another one that lives for a week, lays eggs, and dies; would you expect the "evolutionary optimal" responses to pain in these species to be similar? Why?

> Examples with autotomy, octopuses.

Two definitions of pain:

1. noniception (reporting of damage), 
2. processing and changes in behavior (that to us often "registers" as subjective perception, related to emotions)

🔥 Now, guess how ethical research in animals works. What we can do, what we cannot do, which things are a "gray zone" and need to be argued and justified? Which things are "more OK", which things are "less OK"? Can we formulate a maxim of some chief principles to guide ethical research in animals? (We assume that some research is important, as we want to help humans who have diseases and traumas)

So, with this in mind, can autonomous robots feel pain?

* Tangent: What about human babies? (Long controversial history here that you can look up. But babies are slightly different, as we give them a cart-blanche for being humans)

How does tetrodotoxin work? Can it be used for analgesia; to block pain during surgeries or something? Why?

What can we infer from the fact that some people don't feel pain, but have all other tactile senses (touch, heat, etc.) What does it mean? What can we guess from this fact, in terms of how our bodies are "constructed"?

Why different people have different pain thresholds? Does pain threshold change in a human (in you) during your normal day-to-day activities? What may change it?

Say, you want to record from a brain of a live pigeon, using electrodes. I'll give you a hint: there are 3 ways to do it that are considered "OK"; any other option is not "OK". Guess these three options that you have?

# Synapse, Terminology, Free Will

## Class 1

refresher QUIZ: "Simple action potential"

*A discussion about pain (above).*

## Class 2: free will

QUIZ: Basic synapse

Why electric and chemical synapses exist?

Why metabotropic receptors exist?

What will happen if you make neurotransmitters stay longer in the synaptic cleft? In particular, what will happen if we do it:

* To all acetylcholine in the body?
* To all serotonin in the brain? (That's what SSRIs do...)

*Maybe: quickly revisit pain and robots.* 

* Where we ended is that the majority vote was that most animals, and maybe even plants, do some sort of pain signaling (reporting damage), but react to it differently (some "suffer", in the sense of changing their behavior to more passive / protective, until they heal, while some don't). But we didn't have time to talk about robots or aliens. So, if a roach feel pain, and then you make a robot with a wire for every neuron, and an appropriate tiny gadget for every synapse, reporting damage to robotic limbs and making robot withdraw from harmful objects... Would you say that this robot feels pain?

Let's briefly talk about free will now. Do these objects have free will?

* Your roommate
* A stone
* A candleflame
* A dog
* A cockroach
* An autonomous robotic mobile garbage collector.
* A blue blobby starlight-feeding alien on a planet far away

How do you know? How would you define free will? Does your definition match your intuitions? Is your definition falsifiable? (Do you have a procedure to "test" an active object for the presence of free will?)

## Lab: Eyewire

Dears, this week the lab is virtual and self-guided: we won't be sitting together on Zoom; you will go through it at your own pace. It's a really nice project, and if you have any questions about it as you go through it, please let me know, or post them here, or email me, or join the office hours Zoom to ask them!

So here's the plan:

1. First read the description: [https://blog.eyewire.org/about/ ](https://blog.eyewire.org/about/)
2. Then create an account, log in.
3. Carefully go through the tutorial. Make sure to get the controls right, especially how to switch the projections:
   https://blog.eyewire.org/getting-started-eyewire-keyboard-and-mouse-commands/ 
4. Once you are fully done with the tutorial, analyze **at least three real cubes**.

Before submitting your last cube to eyewire, **make a screenshot of your screen, and post it below, in the thread**. This will count towards your participation in this lab. You don't have to write a lab report, but I want to see a cube that is done well, with some effort 🙂

And honestly, it's a fun project. When I tried it the first time, I got carried away, and edited about 20 cubes or so, just because I forgot to stop :) It gets addictive if you are into this sort of brainy things :)

# Ethology. Inhibition. Synaptic integration

## Class 1: Ethology

*Pep talk on how it is OK to be confused (class on a new topic like a fantasy book where for the first several pages you aren't even sure if the hero is human, and whether there are any dragons in this world, and who the hell is Yennifer.*

💡 QUIZ: Locations (the one with 4 options)

"Define Fixed Action Pattern"
like, in practice, how would you know that something is a Fixed Action Pattern? Imagine that you're on an island. And there's a population of purple 6-legged lizards on this island. You have a year to study them. How will you know that something they do deserves to be called a Fixed Action Pattern?

Come up with a list of behaviors in that seem to satisfy the definition of a fixed action pattern:

* In squirrels (?)
* In cats
* In dogs (?)

"This squid is scared"
1) Can we say it at all? Would this statement make any sense?
2) What would it mean if we agree that sometimes we can say it? Like what would we mean when we say that an animal is scared?

## Class 2: Synapse and integration

Logistic note: when posting questions, please post them as "Unresolved". As I answer them, or read them, I'll mark them "resolved". Same if you respond to my response! As everyone can flip this switch, this feature is not very reliable, but it will be easier for me to spot new questions if they are marked that way, you know? Otherwise it may be a while till I go on a quest of revisiting every thread, and checking the thread of it.

And I'm a bit behind with answering the questions, but I'll do all the responses tomorrow, and then I'll try to set some time on Sunday or Monday to answer the next portion, for next week.

💡 QUIZ: Transmitters

Selected student questions:

* In the second lecture you mentioned that sleep, while complex, is on the 'more inhibition' side of things. I'm curious about this because I wonder what our brain is doing when we are trying to fall asleep. Are more inhibitory neurotransmitters being used to "shut us down" and allow ourselves to become unconscious? Also I've heard that our brains are very active while we are asleep, how are we able to stay asleep while many neurons are still firing? Do we have a specific part of our brain that isn't spiking, which allows us to sleep?
* For the article on dendritic computations, The argument presented single neurons and their dendrites as processors within processors. Apparently dendrites have their own activation thresholds, have localized spikes, and can act as AND gates. Given that neurons were considered as simple switches, could this effect neuroscience further than incorrect models? Wouldn't there be computational or functional assumptions that rely on the basis of "dumb neurons"?
* If some neurons shoulder more than others, could there be smarter clusters of neurons?
* The two readings on ethology and neuroethology make me wonder about the specific relationship that psychology and modern psychoanalysis have with older fields of ethology and zoology. Does modern psychology come as a direct result of broad studies in behavioral patterns such as aggression/emotional regulation? Or, did this question of the mind come side by side ethology?
* It seems like more often in neurology, neuroethology involves studying species that aren’t usually considered “lab species”. Consequently, are there more often ethical dilemmas that scientists face or critics raise? Does studying more “complex” species give rise to greater ethical questions? How could we not then question our study of “lower” life forms? 
* Seeing the individual dendrite intelligence reminded me of mycelium hyphae (the tendrils). I wonder if mycelium also communicates using action potential. It would make sense given it is a living mass. I tried to google it and I couldn't find a good answer. We also have mostly been discussing the animal kingdom, so I wonder if plants and fungi store more information in the root systems.

💎 *Prepping for next week:*

* Some fixed action patterns involve a periodic sequence of events, like a periodic motion, or a bunch of periodic motions. Next week we will talk about networks that can support these periodic motions; these networks even have a special name: Central Pattern Generators, as they generate a pattern (that is repeated again and again), and are controlling it centrally, from the nervous system. So, let's try to to list some stable behaviors, some fixed action patterns, that involve a very repetitive periodic motion?
* *(first collect some in a large group, to set the tone, then maybe send to small groups)*

# Small networks. CPGs. Escape in fish

## Class 1: CPG

What's a CPG?

What's a Central Pattern Generator?

How to ultimately prove that a circuit is a CPG?

💡 QUIZ: If you watched a lecture about CPGs, I do this thing there where I ask you to think about all other behaviors that can be mediated by CPGs, and then I give some answers. So even tho I gave those answers, let's do it again here now. In groups, create a list of all behaviors that are mediated by a CPG (or at least look as if they could be mediated by one?) Try to come up with new examples!

Questions from last week?

Selected student questions:

* If fish only a few hours old is able to escape danger quickly depending on having large neuron that functions at the same level as the adult fish, my question then is what about the human babies that make them so slow and unable to react to danger, even at a year old their reaction to pain seems to be delayed, should I assume that a larger multicellular brain is responsible. Also, is the inhibitor neurons more active in a human baby? 
* While fish cannot be schizophrenic, they still clearly experience frightening situations, and respond to them in a similar way to humans; also, by using certain medications we can simulate how, if a fish had schizophrenia, its PPI would lessen. Just like in humans, they require an inhibitory mechanism to stop an overly strong reaction to a situation that is not actually scary, or else they would be too overwhelmed to function. So, to what extent does the drug-induced state in fish resemble schizophrenia? Is the fish's baseline "anxiety" higher with this drug than it would normally be? I'm wondering how fish experience fear.

## Class 2

💡 QUIZ: Inhibitory synapse (bubbles)

Discuss together:

* I think I've heard of reflective walking behavior in newborns where they are held about a projection of moving dots to simulate the visuals of walking and their limbs responded in a walking sort-of motion? I'm curious about other reflexes that are observed in infants that disappear in adults- why do they disappear? Developmentally it makes sense that eventually babies don't need to grasp/suck on everything because they learn, but what happens neurologically that results in these reflexes going away?
* Another question about motion but not locomotion- I like to sew while listening to video lectures sometimes. That is a learned skill not as innate as walking (probably) but it follows a similar pattern of looping and cyclical changes, and you can move faster/slower and begin to run on "autopilot" after a while. Is the regulation of this kind of rhythm the related to the regulation of walking/breathing/etc?
* To what degree can CPG's function like "clocks?" Are they only useful for short-term rhythmic signaling like walking? I'm thinking of the circadian rhythm, and especially sleep cycles. I've read that brain activity normally follows a kind of sleep pattern, where different brainwaves are more prevalent at different times after falling asleep, and how this is related to REM sleep. Does something like a CPG govern how long the brain stays in each stage of sleep? Or am I totally off the mark, and sleep is way more complicated than CPGs can handle? 	
* Also a somewhat related question from last week:
  * I'm curious as to how these excitatory and inhibitory synapses relate to energy levels, and being tired or more awake, and then how this relationship gets effected by addictions (if it is a more direct relationship). For example, in your second lecture, you explain how when there is no spiking (no excitatory actions) then people are pretty much in a coma, and when everything is spiking (no inhibitory actions) then people will be seizuring. Is the ratio or level of excitatory vs. inhibitory changing depending on how awake you are, like in the AM are less excitatory synapses firing than later in the day?  And also how do supplements effect this ratio? Like when you drink coffee and get the jitters, is this related to a higher level of excitatory synapses firing?
  * Do we have less spiking in the brain when we study for Neuro class, as opposed to being idle, or watching Netflix?
* Also:
  * When watching your lecture, after reading the wiki articles and the various videos on the patellar reflex, I was reminded of and thought of a strange sensation that I sometimes experience, which is when I am on the edge of sleep and something, maybe a reflex (?) jolts my body. This jolt brings me out of sleep and wakes me a bit. I have heard of other people experiencing this phenomenon as well. Is this connected to a neurological reflex, or would this be connected to a spinal signal? Is the Mauthner cell involved in this? 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk

Comment on:

* what makes me still uneasy is that unpredictability only exists because of the danger of predictability. it seems more to be a codependence and is still very reactionary…
* Also:
  * In your lecture on small networks, you talked about the tentacled snake, that tricks fish into escaping into its mouth.  How did this species evolve neurologically?  Was the escape pattern of the fish so predictable that the species "observed" how the fish could easily be caught?  And are fish in the Southeast Asian seas better at escaping because their predators are smarter than in other parts of the world?  You said that randomness can be generated through neurons being developed that create noise.  How would this look in the neurological development of fish who were preyed upon by tentacled snakes?
*  If humans come from a fish, does the fast escape response in fish equate to our reflexes as humans now? did we once have this reflex/did it just change or disappear through evolution?

💎 *Prepping for next week:*

* Try to list as many senses as you can. Both human senses, but also ones that other non-human animals use.
  You already mentioned: sight, taste, smell. hearing, and touch. Expand the list! :)

## Lab: Randomness and Locomotion

this week's labs are both virtual, and will take about an hour of your time. It's two simple games that both are almost impossible to win (sorry for that :)

**Part 1: Try to be random**

Please visit this link: https://www.expunctis.com/2019/03/07/Not-so-random.html

Read the description, and play the game several times (every time just reload the page).

In short, if you manage to be unpredictable, you win. But if you behave similarly to how you have behaved in the past, you lose. Use arrow keys for "left" and "right", and watch the plot to track your "money". Play the game, and count how many clicks it takes you to lose your first 60 bucks (the moment when the balance of 940 becomes visible on the Y-axis for the first time as you start with 1000 virtual dollars in your pocket).

Try at least 2 different strategies. Which strategy worked better?

Fig 1. It took your instructor 267 steps to lose their first $60.

**Part 2: Try to be a CPG**

Visit this link: http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html

Read the description. Then play the game.

Your goal for this lab it pass the 5 meters mark. (Not even 100 meters. Not even "run"). Just, in any way, dead or alive, pass the 5 meters mark :)

Suffer for at least 10 full minutes. Try different techniques. Then if everything fails, watch some youtube tutorials (easily findable). Then suffer some more. Try again and again, exploring different strategies, until you cross the 5 meters mark, or you have worked on it for 30 minutes straight, whichever comes first :)

Fig 2. As you can see from this figure, your instructor hates this game with passion, but this should neither bias not discourage you! :))

**Writing response**

For each lab, write a paragraph, describing at least two different strategies that you tried in this lab, and how productive they were. Then meditate for 10 minutes, and add one more sentence, describing how it relates to our understanding of the brain, life, and ourselves ;)

Feel free to post screenshots to document your success (or the lack thereof haha, it's also fun :)

The due date for this lab is the end of this week. Best of luck, and may the games begin!

# Neural Coding

## Class 1: Senses

Questions:

* Do senses develop/grow as animals age? For example, what's the difference between a baby versus an adult in how well they're able to use their senses. I assume as we run into specific stimuli (prick of needles, the smell of something burning, the sound of a dog barking) our brain learns what these things mean and we can use that to our advantage; but what about the actual ability to sense stimuli? Are babies more sensitive to stimuli and can smell or taste better than an adult can? Do our brains help us tune our senses as we grow?
* In the second lecture, you talked about how our sensing of bitterness in taste is sort of similar to our perception of pain–– in that both signal that an external stimulus is hurtful. This idea of distinguishing whether things that you put in your mouth are chemically harmful or not made me think of supertasters. Supertasters are people who experience taste with more intensity than an average person. Wikipedia related this supertasting to a heightened sensitivity to PROP, and while unknown, it is thought to be caused by a genetic mutation. 
* Are there reasons why supertasting would be advantageous outside of avoiding toxic foods? Or in contrast, could this be a genetic disadvantage, due to the fact that supertasters often have a more limited diet, lacking in important food groups such as vegetables? 
* The way the reading talked about how vision and hearing sense is somewhat uniform across people and how taste is much more subjective made me critically think about the odd nature of taste. Are these taste preferences all genetic? Are they based on environment? Is there a deeper reason why taste is more subjective than some of the other Aristotelian senses? 
* 📗  I am extremely fascinated by the idea that our receptors can be "tricked" specifically our hot and cold receptors. I assume these receptors have a function- to tell us if we are too cold or too hot and urge us to take the necessary precaution to fix the situation. 
  * A general discussion (may be a repetition, but it's an important one). Imagine that we have some thing X in our bodies, and you wonder what purpose it has. Is it a valid question? And what are the possible answers?
    * (Three options that we have here)
* Sense of balance, vertigo, and sea-sick-ness. Why do people get sick if you sway them back and forth again and again, or rotate them for a while?
* While watching your lecture about taste, smell, and non-human senses, a few questions came to my mind. Considering the fact that humans can basically taste five types of flavors (sweet, salty, bitter, sour, and umami), I am wondering if there are any types of food or flavors that cannot be categorized into one of those types. I am also wondering about the idea of receptors and what happens when one is blocked. For example, when someone has to eat or drink something that they do not like the flavor of, they will often pinch their nose when swallowing the food to lessen the flavor. I know that not being able to smell something may make some of the flavor go away, but I am wondering why exactly this happens beyond just not being able to smell it. I know that you said that most of what we perceive as taste is actually just smell, but I’m still a bit confused on the idea that taste buds aren’t very powerful at all without smell involved. Since you said that food is mainly about texture and smell, I am curious to know if there are people that cannot differentiate textures from one another and what exactly would cause that. Would that be caused by the brain or within the mouth itself?
* In your lecture on Sensory Modalities, you discuss how plants have evolved to have a defense mechanism of capsaicin or menthol, and how humans enjoy eating these plants even though these traits aren't meant to be enjoyed. My question is have we evolved to become a kind of masochists when we eat peppers, horseradish, mustard, etc. or is this somehow an unintentional behavior we possess?
* My question might be too simple it has to do with taste but could apply to smell in certain cases. You said that things like hot pepper has chemicals that cause or mimic the reaction to heat in our neurons, does that mean when one person gets used to ever increasing levels of spicy are they causing damage to the neurons on the mouth?
* In your lecture on Taste, Smell, and non-human senses, I was thinking about Human evolution and wondering if the size of your brain has to do anything with the experience of your senses? For example, neanderthals, although a distant relative to the human, supposedly had larger skulls and brain sizes compared to the modern human. Would the size change the way senses were perceived for the neanderthals? 
* The idea of having receptors for different smells feels like having recepetors for specific wavelength in one's eye. Which clearly is not the case
* While watching the lectures and videos what I kept thinking about is how humans, especially in the west have modified food so much that we are now used to eating heightened levels of sugar, salt and acidity.
* I was wondering what the neural process looks like for humans when a sense is lost. Do other senses actually get stronger? 

## Class 2: Coding

💡 Quiz: Match the names to the codes

(now as we know which coding system is which:) 

* So, what would be the upsides and downsides of each coding system? 
* Where would you expect to find each of them in the brain?
* Which one (or ones?) are most common (guess!), which ones are less common? Why?

Make wild guesses about what systems in the brain could be most likely to use temporal and phase codes

# Sound and Hearing

## Class 1: Ear, preliminary

Finish coding quiz: Where would you expect to find each coding type in the bran (or in the body outside of the brain)? What would be "good use cases" for each of them?

Draw the ear together?

Questions:

* How would an eardrum burst without tangible force, like shoving a cotton swab into your era? I know it’s possible for eardrums to burst upon hearing really loud noises, so how does that occur? Hearing loud noises for a long time, according to the reading, can lead to hearing loss when you’re older, but that happens through tearing of the hair fibers on hair cells, not rupturing of the eardrum. Does it have to do with pressure, or too much stimulus/vibration?
* In your lecture you talked about how our ears can adjust how sensitive we are to noise based on our environments by either stretching or shortening the tensor tympanic muscle. For people that are hypersensitive to certain sounds, I think this is called hyperacusis, does their tensor tympanic muscle not stretch? A short google search of hyperacusis said it normally develops after being exposed to too many loud noises at a young age, does this mean that the muscle can wear out over time? 

My question

* So, why do we have cochlea at all? Why wouldn't we put a bunch of  hair cells right next to the membrane, and be done with it?
* How does cochlea work? You have a long thingie, you'll place hair cells there, but how to separate a complex vibration into frequencies?
* What makes different parts of it sensitive to different frequencies?

Again student's question:

* The cochlea's shape stood out to me as a human part, even though there are plenty examples of spirals in nature. I was looking up the evolution of the cochlea in early humans and it seems that our cochlea began shorter and smaller. Was the evolutionary reason in part because of speech? Or was this just because one the spiral was sent into motion it would only make sense to continue? Assuming humans could have more time to evolve, would our ear design become more geared for durability given speakers and increased noise? 
* Rephrased: 1. Why is cochlea spiral? 2. And why is it "more spiral" in humans than in most other animals (including many mammals)?

## Class 2: Ear, more serious

That's where we need to discuss how cochlea works.

Questions:

* Do new hair cells grow back when old ones die?
* Why when our hearing degrades over time, higher frequencies are the first to be lost?

* Helen heard distorted versions of the world. Can cochlear implants be tuned in order to hear noises and speech clearly? Can people with these devices still engage in a cocktail party effect naturally?
  * That said, are there ways to make tis electrical process more accurate? Would Helen's hearing be more sensitive if there were more electrodes in the cochlea? Or alternatively, is there a way to simulate, or to rework hair cells? 
  * **My question here:** so what is the limitation here?
* How do our ears hear sounds differently than, say, birds? I always hear birds singing and wonder if they are hearing pitches that we can't. is our hearing a spectrum like color in that there are sounds that are just impossible to comprehend with the human ear? And not just extremely high or low frequencies. are there frequencies BETWEEN the frequencies? Like a green between yellow and blue, but instead it's between a G and an G#?
* Cephalopods are completely deaf while snakes have no visible ears. They are able to feel vibrations through their jawbones. Why would it be an evolutionary advantage for some animals to be deaf or nearly deaf when it is so important to other species? It seems that some species depend on their ability to hear while others comfortably live without it.

### Questions from the olden class

* Why do we have earwax?
* Why with hearing loss, the sensitivity to higher frequencies is lost first? (Believe me, you can answer this one using your common sense)
* What makes different parts of the cochlea tuned to different frequencies, and how does cochlea work, in general?
* How do cochlear implants work?
  * Three sub-questions:
    How do they work?
    Why do they sound so weird? (Based on the examples you heard in the video)
    How come people still manage to use them, and function, if they are so weird?
  * https://auditoryneuroscience.com/prosthetics/noise-vocoded-speech
  * https://auditoryneuroscience.com/prosthetics/music
* Some people are very sensitive to loud noises. While others may be fine in a loud room or with music turned up high, this actually hurts their ears. What do you think could be the mechanism here?
* How des tinnitus work?
* I also think because I blast music and attended many concerts with loud music that I have probably damaged my hearing. Could one undo this damage?  

## Class 3: Sound localization

Questions we talked about last class:

*  Why is it that when we hit a certain age, we may not be able to hear some of the sounds that babies are able to hear?
* I am also wondering if there are any sounds so powerful that they can destroy your eardrum?

Also a question from last week we haven't discussed yet:

* Tinnitus - where does it come from?

Now, how can one figure out where the sound is coming from? (There are 3 ways)

Hard question: how can the our brain detect interaural phase difference?

* Subquestion: what type of coding should the spiral ganglion use to make it possible?
* Now let's say we have a nucleus that receives phase-locked spikes from both ears. How can neurons in this nucleus calculate the position of the source of this sound?

New questions:

* After watching the documentary on Ben Underwood, I have a similar question to someone else: did he learn how to use echolocation on his own or did he start using the technique after learning about this concept? Would echolocation be a faster method for sound identification and localization than using a walking stick? What made him different than the rest when adjusting to his loss of sight? Why did he develop this echolocation behavior and not others who have lost their eyesight? Was it something different in the shape of his pinna or cochlear that allowed him to develop this skill? Is it possible to use echolocation for fine motor skills, such as writing, painting, or fastening buttons?  
* I remember when I was in middle school, I did an experiment. When I close my eyes and someone claps his hand around me, I can easily know the direction of the sound source. But in daily life, sometimes I hear the sound of an alarm or the ringing of my cell phone (especially when I can't find my phone), it is difficult for me to find the source of the sound or even looked in the opposite direction. Why sometimes people can't tell the direction of the sound?
* In the video about Hearing New York in 3D, the guy talks about how there are videos on the internet that play certain frequencies that could potentially stimulate parts of the brain that make you more concentrated, or tired, or creativity. Obviously, this stuff is totally not real, but in a more professional lab scenario, are there things you could potentially do to stimulate these types of responses? For example, is there some connection between the ear and the part of your brain that controls how focused or non-focused you are, like how axons from the inner ear lead to the cortex? Or are the claims those people are making just absolutely not based in any science at all?

## Class 4: Music 1

Questions:

* So the inferior colliculus responds for finding where the sound is whilst the auditory cortex is responsible for determining what the sound was. This makes me wonder what would happen if the inferior colliculus is damaged for example. Would the person be able to identify the sound but not be able to tell where it’s coming from or does damage of one of these two parts implies losing hearing completely? Could infections or daily loud noises impact the ability of the cortex and colliculus of identifying the sounds and its location? In other words, is damage preventable?
* For musicians, some have absolute pitch and some have relative pitch. If the brain has the ability to remember sound waves, that is not a good thing for people with absolute pitch. When the pitch tune to different Hz, the pitch sounds different so is relative pitch and absolute pitch born, or is it possible to achieve it through training the day after? I am a musician with relative pitch and I often practice myself to have absolute pitches at the same time but I haven't succeeded yet.
* In your first lecture, you talk about how the vocal cords vibrate at different frequencies to create certain sounds. How do vocal cords in people develop differently? How do people develop accents (ex; British). I know people who sound exactly like their parents/ someone from their family. How does someone's voice get passed down genetically
* I really enjoyed the video about soundwaves and harmonics. I knew what harmonics were prior to watching the video, but I did not realize how they were created. If I understood correctly, multiplying the frequency of a note introduces more harmonics. Moreover, harmonics are created by multiplying the frequency of the fundamental note. This made me think about my choir days in high school. Occasionally, when we weren't too pitchy, we would hear an overtone. Overtones are notes that you can hear but are not being sung. Is this the same thing as harmonics? How are overtones created in terms of soundwaves and frequency? Are the notes being heard but unsung the result of the increased frequency of the fundamental note?
* I understand that higher and lower frequencies interact differently with the varying stiffness of the basilar membrane as the cochlea winds but how do the different frequencies interact with our nervous systems?  Do higher or lower frequency sounds put us more "on guard?" 
* One more question: when thinking about music, why do certain tones trigger our nervous system in different ways? Why does a major scale create different sorts of emotions compared to sounds coming from a minor scale? What is this process neurologically? 
* Is there any reason why sometimes we like sounds and sometimes we don't? Such as with music tastes. Does it have anything to do with which of our hair cells have died or is more of a mental thing and personal taste?
  * Here on origins of music (presentation)
  * Two examples to guess what's happening:
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1vPn5KTTT4
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEigxkAYj0I&t=5m36s 

* I've heard this before, but the second lecture confirms the fact that babies/young kids learn different languages easier than an adult. Hearing you talk about the different tones in different languages clarified this, but at what age do kids start differentiating these tones? Is there an ideal age to learn a language or a maximum amount of languages that a baby can be learning at once?

# Scientific ecosystem workshop

Questions:

* How can octopuses and cuttlefish live while completely deaf?
* How can snakes live while completely deaf? Why did they loose hearing?
* Why some sounds (like chalk against the board, or metal on asphalt) are so unpleasant?

write workshop:

* Find a good paper (GoogleScholar)
* Anatomy of a paper (sections)
* Why some papers are not in public access? Who gets the money?
  * Publishers, OpenAccess, SciHub
* What the difference between blog posts and scientific papers? 
  * How does peer-review work?
  * elife - find a paper on hearing and work with it
* Are all journals about equally good?
  * What defines a good journal?
  * Which journals are good?
  * Which journals are more reliable?
* Who actually wrote the paper? (Authorship)
* Where does the money for research come from?
* 🔥 How to find other papers on a similar topic?
  * Past (citations)
  * Future (forward citations)
  * Semantic Scholar

Final test task:

* Let's figure out why different music triggers different emotions. Or maybe more general, how does music trigger emotions overall? What do we know about it? Or maybe more narrow, what about major chords and minor chords? Is one of them happy, and another one sad? What do we know about it?
* Strategies: how to make sure we don't read pure musicology and art history, but actually look at something in the realm of psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience?
  * Which words would you add?
* Now working in groups, try to answer the question, then we get together and share.

# Vision 1 - the eye

## Class 1

* Draw an eye, what's in the eye - discuss
* Draw together, discuss
* Structure of the retina
  * What photoreceptors are there?
  * What's the difference between them? (Rods vs Cones)
  * What is rod spectral sensitivity? Why?
  * What are peak sensitivities for cones? What colors are each of the cones most sensitive for?
  * Why? What does it mean? Come up with some hypotheses, from the common sense pov.

## Class 2

You might have heard that the image in the eye is upside-down somehow, and that the brain (that's what they say) needs to "learn" to turn it upside-up...

* Is it hard for the brain to learn that the image on the retina is flipped? Would it be easier if it weren't flipped?
* How would it look like of somebody's brain failed to "learn it"?
* How do you feel about this statement in general?

So, are there entirely different colors that birds can see, but we can't? How does it work?

How does night vision work?

1. What do we know about dark vision?
2. Why doesn't kick in instantaneously?
3. How long does it take?
4. What ruins it / preserves it? Why?
5. Guess why some animals (cats, owls?) have better night vision?

## Self-guided vision lab

Dears, our labs this week are self-guided. Here they are!

Make sure to do all of these exercises below. (each exercise is only about 1-2 minutes long, except for the last one that is like 5 minutes long). In total, it should take only about an hour of your time, or maybe 1:15 tops, with the videos, but it is really, really worth it! 

1. Watch this video, and do everything they recommend (you'll need a piece of paper, a pencil, and a wall. You can also use a computer screen if you make it uniformly white, like by maximizing a white GoogleDoc document or something like that): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_W-IXqoxHA 

2. Watch this video, and do everything they recommend (you'll have to go outside and stare at the sky at some point): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKQT1MXfasM

3. Watch this video, think about it, and do the exercises (you'll need a mirror): https://vimeo.com/54546597 

4. Blind spot mapping:

* Read this description: https://coglab.cengage.com/labs/blind_spot.shtml 

* Then this page: http://nivea.psycho.univ-paris5.fr/FeelingSupplements/BlindSpotFillingInExperiments.htm

* Finally, ran this lab: http://avtanski.net/projects/blindspot/ 

(Ironically, the program uses a green/red color scheme, so it is invisible to red/green colorblind people. Yep. If you are colorblind, I'm sorry, you cannot use this app. It's so weird that somebody who cares about vision would make a program that doesn't work on ~5% of population for vision reasons, isn't it?)

As a write-up for this set of exercises, pick the exercise that you liked the most (that you found most interesting, most fun, or most informative), and write either a haiku, a limerick, or a sonnet about it. (Use Wikipedia to learn the rules of each genre, if unsure). Post it below!

# Lab-like-assignment: Simple Writer

Dears, as announced, we don't have a lab this time around, but we have a short writing assignment instead.

Here are the rules:

- Very carefully read this comic: https://xkcd.com/1133/
- Then watch this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p_8gx-XHJo
- Very carefully study this page from the book "Things explainer": http://i.cbc.ca/1.3390492.1452021709!/fileImage/httpImage/thing-explainer.jpg
- Then use this link to access the simple writer: https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/
- Now, **pick any smart term or clever concept that we studied in this course** so far. Anything, starting from ions and channels, and to sensory systems, or brain regions – anything that we studied. Pick one term or concept. Then **try to write an encyclopedia entry for it using only simple words**! Describe the meaning of it, add some details, tell a story. The SimpleWriter will alert you if your words are not simple enough. So please only use simple words. **Write a paragraph of text** (at least 150 words, but the more, the better, as it's freaking hard!!). Make sure it provides a good, detailed description. Go on tiny tangents if you want to (like they did in that youtube video). It may help to set the picture right (and may actually be easier to write!)
- Post your paragraph below!
- **Don't tell anyone what you were trying to describe!** It goes without saying that you cannot use the word that you are describing. Make all readers (including your instructor) try to guess what you meant!
- Try to describe something unique; don't do terms that are already taken by other people! Granted, some description may be obscure, so you won't be sure what they describe... Or maybe you find a much better way to describe a term. But try to pick something original. It means that the first few participants will have an easier time (they can pick simple things like "brain" or "neuron"), while later contributors will have to be more creative. But we studied LOTS of fancy terms and concepts in this course, so it should not be a problem to find something for everyone ;)
- Good luck! And let me know if you have any questions!

# Vision 2 - in the brain

## Class 1 - Motion detection

⭐ Quizzes:

* Types of retinal cells
* Overall morphology of the eye

**On motion detection**

https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2BJQE7DA74YSDKUF75ZYUT73FQ.gif
1) Introspect what's going on, and if there's anything funny, what is it?
verbalize it
2) What does it tell us about how our visual system works?

Rotating circles illusion (two slightly different versions):

* https://i.imgur.com/xwC0ZEM.gif
* https://i.imgur.com/zoopK6j.gif

**Motion aftereffect:**

* Weaker but easier to understand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dupz1mmwpQU
* Stronger, but harder to tease apart: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkRHN0rnfME&t=20s

Your goal is to watch the video, then discuss with other people what happened, they discuss how the video probably worked, then discuss what could it mean for how our brain work. Like, what had happened?

Flash-lag effect:

* https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-flashLag/

⭐ Quiz about inhibition?

Then: **how can motion detection be organized?**

**The other way around:**  (illusions of motion)

* https://desktopdressedup.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/ill_29.png

* https://i.imgur.com/h9okP.jpg

1) Share what you see, try to find the logic
2) What could it mean? A hint: it's a consequence of a cool process that's "running in the background" when you see, but in this case it's getting a bit faulty. What could it be about?

### Information

1. No lab on Tuesday
2. A short fun writing assignment (will be posted today)
3. The final paper is now shorter than it was originally described in the syllabus (only 2 pages, and based on only 2 papers + review, not 2 papers and 2 reviews)
4. I will post a topic-collecting note on Piazza today

## Class 2 - Cortical processing

⭐ Quizzes:

* Clever sensory-related words
* Simple saccades

💡 Two announcements:

* About mid-term grades
* Reminder of the logic (that B to A estimations are mostly guesses at this point)

* Reminder about final papers; how to find stuff on Google scholar, and SciHub.

⭐ Anoter quiz:

* inhibition (as a prep for next topic)

**Motion detection - how does it work**?

**Towards line detection**

* Remember the videos you watched, and the stuff you read, about how orientation-selective cells in the primary visual cortex work.
* In the retina we have this: (draw center-surround inhibition on a whiteboard)
* But in V1 (primary visual cortex) we have this: (pic of line detection)
* **THE QUESTION:** How to get from cells with receptive fields like in the retina (top pic) to those like in the cortex (bottom pic)? How do you connect stuff to get orientation selective cells?

**Toads**

1) Within your group, summarize the toad vision experiments (from those videos you watched). How does this whole worm / antiworm thing works?
2) If you were to summarize the results of this study to a philosophy student, what would you say? What is one take-home message from these experiments, in terms of "how the brain (or world) work"?
3) Are these behaviors, and this type of perception, innate or learned, in frogs?
4) Do humans have anything similar? Obviously, we learn to recognize our family, squirrels, and letters. But are there things that we recognize in a hardwired way?

💎 QUESTIONS FROM PIAZZA:

* Since the many different parts of vision occur in different parts of the brain, how common is it for someone to be only able to have some parts of a complete vision? (Ex: the part of the brain that does color doesn't work but the part that does shape works)

# Morphology, Methods

⭐ Quizzes:

* Fish + coronal sagittal etc.

Methods of research in the brain (brainstorm, follow with slides)

* How can we (humans) learn what brain region does what? How we probably learned it originally, and what fancy methods can we use for it now? Brainstorm about 10 very different methods, if you can, from very simple, to very fancy!

Slides from the morphology lecture: 

* look at some pics, 
* recognize and name areas, 
* discuss what they do (quick and dirty labels)

Why fore-mid-and-hindbrain regions are called that way? What's the secret here?

# Illusions

Quizzes

* Gollum and friends (on saccades)

# Emotions

Announcements:

* Answered all topics
* Some people posted their topics anonymously, so now I can only hope that you either recognize your submission, or got a response for me. I'm particularly worried about 2 students towards the end, where one of the students responded to another student instead of posting a new entry. I hope both of you got my response, but I can't be sure...
* If you really hate your topic, or if you are confused about it, write me an email.
* 3 pages max, normal-spaced; so not more than 1500 words (a change again, but 2 pages wasn't doable). More details in the syllabus: https://github.com/khakhalin/Teaching/blob/master/Intro_Neuroscience/neuro_syllabus_remote_2021.md
* But here's a reminder for you: 3 papers, 2 primary (describing a study, ideally an experiment), and 1 review. A "primary" paper is one that presents new data; typically you can tell that that's the case because it has all the required sections: "introduction, methods, results, and discussion". Super-short and punchy papers, like those published in Nature and Science, may sometimes lack these subtitles, but even then, they still have these sections "in spirit", just shorter. But still, there's a description of what the researchers did, and where they got the data from, and how they processed these data, and what the results are. Often also a table or a figure. That's how you tell it's a research paper, and not a review or opinion.
* So please try to find 2 primary papers (not reviews) on this topic. They may be a bit less interesting to read than reviews, as ultimately they will report something like "we did this very specific thing, and observed this very specific result that is rather hard to understand", but in a way it's way easier to write about, and also it's much closer to what scientific journalists actually write about. Unless you are a specialist in the topic, you cannot possibly give an decent overview of an entire field in 3 pages!! But you can briefly explain 2 new results in 3 pages.
* Try to use post-2010, or at least post-2000 papers
* please avoid speculative psychology (not experiment-based, but poetry-based), as well as general cultural commentary. Avoid papers that are pure sociology or humanities. Also And avoid opinion papers, perspectives, editorials etc. - they are also in the database, and they are also cited, but we are not after them. You can include any these papers in your story once you have 2 hard science, but don't make them your primary sources, for this class.
* reminder on how to search: google scholar, then if necessary go forward and backwards in time using citations. Also sci-hub exists
* The final paper doesn't need to be perfect. We don't have time for perfection; perfection is boring. It needs to be an honest effort. Not a stylistic imitation (we don't care about style), but you need to read 2 empirical studies, and try to write about them, putting then into context, and actually trying to explain to the imaginary reader what happened.

Define an emotion? What is an emotion?

Try to come up with a working definition of what an emotion is.

There's of course a definition on Wikipedia, but it's not too helpful. And one of the reasons it's not that helpful is that, I think, there are at least 2 very different uses for this word in our common language / thinking. So if can sketch both, that would be ideal. (But even if you only do one, as we have different groups, probably together well find both)

And let's give a scientific, not a poetic definition, where "scientific" doesn't mean "smart-sounding", but rather "actionable". We want to be able to use this definition in the future, and tackle various questions, For example we can ask: "Do cats have emotions? Do goldfish have emotions?" Try to define emotions in ways that are actually useful.



Why do we have emotional states?

Why do we have emotional responses?

* "Two systems"

How to tell whether a dog, a bird, or a snake has emotions?

* Bees example

Can a robot have emotions?

* That I have a cognitive dissonance here myself

# Cortex

Start with an announcement of no classes next week

Cortex:

* draw a brain
* locate primary cortices
* Locate in-betweens
  * Figure out the planning one
  * the spatial one
  * the language one
* Explain memory
* Two visual streams: define, guess which one is which
* Language areas
  * Draw a typical path of connections for listening
  * For responding an email

# Language

Quizzes:

* brain regions again (7-8 min, not 5 - it takes them some time)

* Draco's spell

Aphasias:

1. How is Wernicke's aphasia different from Broca's?
2. Where are the Wernicke's and Broca's areas in the brain?
3. Can we see any logic in where they are located, that could help us to remember their role?

# Frontal regions

Reminders:

* Show pictures for language-related connections. What is happening here?

Then a lecture on frontal regions

💡 Reminder that we have a peer-review session for those who are writing papers. Plus I can answer any questions about papers.

## Morality, creativity

* Question of frontal lobes developing until 30s
* Talk about the Marshmallow test
* About creativity 

Some questions to think about:

- 1) Why would (or maybe "How could") a feeling of moral and immoral actions and behaviors develop evolutionary? Where did these concepts come from? What's the point of having them, in terms of survival?
- 2) Overall are moral behaviors (broadly speaking) good for animals, in terms of helping their survival? Or is it more beneficial for animals to act "immorally"? (whatever it means?)
- 3) What are the mechanisms (brain regions, cognitive mechanisms etc.) behind the moral intuitions in humans? How can they fail? And how can we live with it?

## Second class

* Quizz about elves and brain regions

# Laterality

Remember language areas? So, what about the right hemisphere?

* prosody music
* you caught a human in whom both hemispheres are heavily involved in language processing. What can you guess about them? (5 min)

Differences between hemispheres

* What have you ever heard about the differences between the left and right hemispheres, and what's your opinion about these statements? (Which sound like true, and which ones are fishy?)
* ask them to list what they heard, but also sort it into 3 buckets: seems right; probably an exaggeration; probably a myth (5 min)
* debrief

Imagine that you ran a person through an fMRI (or fancy EEG) study, and realized that BOTH sides of their brain are really involved with language. What guesses can you make about this person?

Now off-topic (or rather an isolated topic): let's do a similar thing with difference between male and female brains. What have you  ever heard, or read, about this topic? First let's generate statements, and then later we'll try to sort them according to how likely they are to be true.
