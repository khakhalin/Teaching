# Class plans (sketches) for the Intro Neuro class

# Intro & Resting membrane potential

First class: syllabus

2nd and 3d classes: Resting membrane potential, questions, + some quizzes.

* Follow-ups on water video: 
  * so, summarize the problem here?
  * why are people in the States are obsessed with hydration? Where did it come from?
  * *Can I come up with some meta-question about discerning bad science? Maybe reference their cit sci experiences? How to tell good science from bad science?*

# Action potential and Pain

Why pain exists? What does it signal?

How do we know if some entity feels pain? Let's consider the following options:

* Your roommate
* A candleflame
* An autonomous robotic mobile garbage collector.
* In the future, those blobby things that live on a purple planet and move around, having some crystals inside, tiny tubes, feeding on star radiation or whatnot? The most general case. Something moves, behaves. How to tell if it feels pain? Is there a way to tell? (If they say no, wat about roommate and candleflame?)
* Fish?
* Cockroach?
* Dog?

Is the quality of pain experienced by a cockroach and a dog similar or different? Who is more in pain? Why?

If you have two animal species, one that lives 30 years and can heal, and another one that lives for a week, lays eggs, and dies; would you expect the "evolutionary optimal" responses to pain in these species to be similar? Why?

(Examples with autotomy, octopuses.)

Two definitions of pain (noniception, peception)

Back to robotic collector. So can robots feel pain?

* What about human babies? (Babies are slightly different, as we give them a cart-blanche for being humans)

Now, guess how ethical research in animals works. What we can do, what we cannot do, which things are a "gray zone" and need to be argued and justified? Which things are "more OK", which things are "less OK"?

So, can we formulate a maxim of some chief principles that guide ethical research in animals?

Say, you want to record from a brain of a live pigeon, using electrodes. I'll give you a hint: there are 3 ways to do it that are considered "OK"; any other option is not "OK". Guess these three options that you have?

# Ethology

"Define Fixed Action Pattern"
like, in practice, how would you know that something is a Fixed Action Pattern?

Imagine you're on an island. And there's a population of purple 6-legged lizards on this island. You have a year to study them. How will you know that something they do is a Fixed Action Pattern?

Come up with a list of behaviors that seem to satisfy the definition of a fixed action pattern

"This squid is scared"
1) Can we say it?
2) What would it mean if we agree that sometimes we can say it? Like what would it mean to claim that an animal is "scared"?

## CPGs class

If you watched a lecture about CPGs, I do this thing there where I ask you to think about all other behaviors that can be mediated by CPGs, and then I give some answers. So even tho I gave those answers, let's do it again here now. In groups, create a list of all behaviors that are mediated by a CPG (or at least look as if they could be mediated by one?) Try to come up with new examples!

Try to list as many senses as you can. Both human senses, but also ones that other non-human animals use.
You already mentioned: sight, taste, smell. hearing, and touch. Expand the list! :)

Student questions:

* Can you explain how the fish escape is related to certain mental illness like schizophrenia in terms of pre-pulse inhibition in humans
* The second lecture got me thinking about people who have phantom limbs and can feel their limbs even though they’ve lost them, because I started wondering  if their motor neurons are still trying to send the other limb signals. How do phantom limbs work? Why do we feel like we can still feel missing parts of our body?
* I know that we were talking about Central Pattern Generators in terms of muscles, but am wondering if there is a similar process that can happen with thoughts. Are there certain neurological responses that can happen repetitively and unconsciously, but in the way that we think? Further, similar to the necessity of a reciprocal muscle relaxing when the muscle connected to the excitatory neuron is flexed, can there be a relationship in the brain in which one thought pattern causes another thought pattern to silence or "relax?"

## Coding class

1) Match the names to the codes
2) So, what would be the upsides and downsides of each coding system? When (where?) would you expect to find them in the brain?

Make wild guesses about what systems in the brain could be most likely to use temporal and phase codes

## Coding class 2

> Given that different sensations can signify danger why have we come to enjoy sensations that previously could indicate something that could kill us like tasting bitterness for instance?

Also briefly comment that it's dangerously short.

> After watching last two lectures, I am thinking about how our senses "decay" after repeated long-term stimulation. For example, when we get into a room that stinks, in the beginning we might feel disgusted. But, after a while, we won't notice this smell anymore. So, is it our neurons that gradually get tired to transfer this information to the brain? Or does the threshold for detecting the smell increase? Or do we somehow "get used to the smell"?

> You also discussed how when a receptor is used it gets stronger, like strengthening a muscle, over time and reversely when a receptor isn’t utilized it weakens and eventually dies out. 

This statement above is only half-true. Please discuss, 1) what is true in it, 2) what is not, 3) how to fix it? How to change it, to make it better reflect the reality of how our brains work?

> As for reasons to why we have a second nostril, could another reason be that we have a second nostril as backup for if the other nostril is clogged? Personally, when I am sick only one nostril gets stuffy and I'm able to catch a little breath through the other nostril that's not clogged and my mouth, so I don't know I was just curious if that could be another reason for why we have pairs of body parts.

**End:** be ready for the lab, have a ruler and some two-pointy device (like a compass, a well-controlled clip, or something like that)

# Hearing

* Why do we have earwax?
* Why with hearing loss, the sensitivity to higher frequencies is lost first? (Believe me, you can answer this one using your common sense)
* What makes different parts of the cochlea tuned to different frequencies, and how does cochlea work, in general?
* How do cochlear implants work?
  * Three sub-questions:
    How do they work?
    Why do they sound so weird? (Based on the examples you heard in the video)
    How come people still manage to use them, and function, if they are so weird?
  * https://auditoryneuroscience.com/prosthetics/noise-vocoded-speech
  * https://auditoryneuroscience.com/prosthetics/music
* Some people are very sensitive to loud noises. While others may be fine in a loud room or with music turned up high, this actually hurts their ears. What do you think could be the mechanism here?
* How des tinnitus work?
* Also when I think of ears I think of acupuncture and how certain parts of the ear connect to certain parts of the body. 
* I also think because I blast music and attended many concerts with loud music that I have probably damaged my hearing. Could one undo this damage?  

# Vision

* Draw an eye, what's in the eye - discuss
* Draw together, discuss
* Structure of the retina
  * What photoreceptors are there?
  * What's the difference between them? (Rods vs Cones)
  * What is rod spectral sensitivity? Why?
  * What are peak sensitivities for cones? What colors are each of the cones most sensitive for?
  * Why? What does it mean? Come up with some hypotheses, from the common sense pov.

## Vision 1

* A comment on the methodology of questions
* Next Wednesday, if there's civil unrest, we may use the class as a therapy session - we'll see, and play it by ear. I'll keep you posted; please check Piazza for updates.
* Postpone one topic? (Shift everything by a week?)
* Self-labs this Friday
* paper

You might have heard that the image in the eye is upside down somehow, and that the brain (that's what they say) needs to "learn" to turn it rightside-up...
Is it hard for the brain to learn that the image on the retina is flipped, and how would it look like of somebody's brain failed to "learn it"?
And I guess how do you feel about this statement in general?

My question is about night vision- why does it take your eyes time to react to the dark? Why do people say that dusk is the most dangerous time to drive in terms of your vision being impaired? why are cats able to see in the dark so much better than other animals?

1) What do we know about dark vision?
2) Why doesn't kick in instantaneously?
3) How long does it take?
4) What ruins it / preserves it? Why?
5) Guess why some animals (cats, owls?) have better night vision?



I understand to a degree how sight works when our eyes are open, but I am wondering why we see flashes of color when we close our eyes?



Also when we dream, what we see has nothing to do with what our eyes are doing right? I know once in REM our eyes move to follow our actions, but where are the images coming from?

As light gets brighter we are pulled out of sleep, so are we still processing everything around us while we are sleeping?



Also for people with Synesthesia, are their eyes telling them that they are seeing something that they’re not or does it skip the eyes and only happen in the brain? Would their eyes dilate if they see something in their mind that would normally make eyes dilate?



Though it's not yet possible, what would happen to the processing of color if someone had an eye transplant? Since we seem to all see colors in slightly different shades, would the person receiving the eye transplant notice a slight difference in the shades of colors (of an object they're familiar with)? I guess this comes down to exactly where these differences in perception come from. 



I have a question about laser eye surgery. By my understanding LASIK is pretty much reshaping the cornea using a laser. However, I'm wondering if "reshaping" the cornea has any harmful effects. The main article quotes "laser surgery is the most common treatment for the wet form but has the disadvantage of destroying normal retinal cells. It also may not be effective in preventing cell proliferation following treatment". So does this mean LASIK doesn't last forever and someone will eventually have to get it again? What happens if normal retinal cells are destroyed through LASIK?

In class, we were talking about how in old age people's vision often gets worse because their lens gets less flexible so it is harder for them to see objects closer up, but why do some people have a far-sighted vision? Is it most common to have issues with the lens or are there other factors?



The frogs were able to detect prey depending on the shape, movement, and number of a figure(s). Obviously these shapes weren't actually food, but the mere suggestion of it being prey because of the factors just mentioned, made the frogs think potential food was around. So I wonder what is the threshold or breaking point before the frogs no longer perceive the figures as food...But I am more curious about this in humans. In one of the attached videos a man showed different images that weren't the actual figure but provided enough essential elements, such as color and vague dimension, that we could perceive them as we know typically of them: for example the legos as different characters such as teenage mutant ninja turtles. What is our threshold before something is no longer perceptible? Is there even a way to measure such a response?

## Vision 2

Motion aftereffect:

* Weaker but easier to understand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dupz1mmwpQU
* Stronger, but harder to tease apart: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkRHN0rnfME&t=20s

Your goal is to watch the video, then discuss with other people what happened, they discuss how the video probably worked, then discuss what could it mean for how our brain work. Like, what had happened?

The other way around:

* https://i.imgur.com/h9okP.jpg

1) Share what you see, try to find the logic
2) What could it mean? A hint: it's a consequence of a cool process that's "running in the background" when you see, but in this case it's getting a bit faulty. What could it be about?

## Vision 3

On papers and final projects:

* Sometimes I approve letters with reservations (like, it's technical, but if you like it - feel free to write about it). These are also "confirmations" that this paper is OK, so if you want to write about it, feel free to. Just be careful. However, if after some more deliberation, you decide to change the paper of your choice, that's also fine. Just respond to my response with a new idea, and mark this conversation as "unresolved" again, so that I would come back to it.
* When working with papers, make sure to read the correspondence between the author and the reviewers. Read what the reviewers disliked, and how the author responded. This is a unique thing about elife journal (no other journal publishes reviews, which is really a shame). So please read them: it will tell you a lot about the paper; it will make it easier to write a good overview of it, but also you'll learn a lot about how science works!
* The principle of self-calibration: I don't want you to reach the same level of proficiency with each of these papers; I want you to put a similar amount of effort, and learn a similar amount of stuff. So if a paper is long and super-weird, it is OK to understand the gist of it, and then understand one figure / method / approach / section in detail. If the paper is short however, or feels particularly accessible, I'll expect you to understand it better. So it's not about picking a harder paper or a simpler paper; strategically. It doesn't matter, ultimately. What matters is that you learn something new, and then tell me about it in a meaningful form ;)

**Rotating square illusion:**

https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2BJQE7DA74YSDKUF75ZYUT73FQ.gif
1) Introspect what's going on, and if there's anything funny, what is it?
verbalize it
2) What does it tell us about how our visual system works?



Rotating circles illusion (two slightly different versions):

https://michaelbach.de/ot/mot-flashLag/



1) Within your group, summarize the toad vision experiments (from those videos you watched). How does this whole worm / antiworm thing works?
2) If you were to summarize the results of this study to a philosophy student, what would you say? What is one take-home message from these experiments, in terms of "how the brain (or world) work"?
3) Are these behaviors, and this type of perception, innate or learned, in frogs?
4) Do humans have anything similar? Obviously, we learn to recognize our family, squirrels, and letters. But is there anything that may be at least somewhat remotely related to these behaviors in toads? Think about humans, and make a guess!!

## Vision 4

* When astronauts are in space and they go to sleep, many of them experience seeing sparks when their eyes are closed. I've heard this is from the amount of radiation in space, but how does the eye actually see these sparks if their eyes are closed. Astronauts always say its because of "radiation" but I'd love to know if you have any knowledge on this topic as well.
* We talked about green/m cones being what we use to determine shadows. Do we have an evolutionary explanation for this? Why green cones? And does this vary between different species? Are there other species that use different cones to best recognize shadow?
* I am interested in what you mentioned about how we can record activation directly from a retina if it is removed from an animal, and spread on a dish. What are some of the benefits and negatives of this approach? It seems like you can get a more focused result because you've eliminated all outside functions of the animal that might interfere with your recordings. I also assume this is a fairly difficult procedure to accomplish, with many areas of possible mistake. Do we lose any important information about the functioning of the retina when we view it in this way?
* In the first lecture it was mentioned that men tend to, overall, have a greater percentage of color blindness compared to women. You also said that the most common color blindness in men is red and green. Later in the lecture it was mentioned that specific species have more red cones in order to see berries. So my question is, evolutionarily speaking, is it possible that women have less color blindness because they were gathers while the men were hunters? Women had to use their detailed vision to locate vibrant berries (red and green in color) while the men needed vision for shapes of moving animals rather than small berries. Perhaps this is also why women tend to have better memory; having to remember where the most fruitful bushels were located.
* Are there people born without specific ganglion cells/can ganglion cells be injured? I would assume so. What affect does that have on the person or creature and can GC be repaired? What happens if you don’t have the coordinate ones for instance? 

# Methods

Methods of research in the brain (brainstorm, follow with slides)

Slides from the morphology lecture: 

* look at some pics, 
* recognize and name areas, 
* discuss what they do (quick and dirty associations)

Why fore-mid-and-hindbrain regions are called that way? What's the secret here?

# Vision

Quizzes on vision

How does this illusion happen?

http://stripgenerator.com/strip/625726/optical-illusion-gradient/



Remember the videos you watched, and the stuff you read, about how orientation-selective cells in the primary visual cortex work.

In the retina we have this: (pic)

But in V1 (primary visual cortex) we have this: (pic)

**THE QUESTION:** How to get from cells with receptive fields like in the retina (top pic) to those like in the cortex (bottom pic)? How do you connect stuff to get orientation selective cells?



Q: I know we have been talking a lot about illusions that people have made to trick our sight, but what examples are there of illusions occurring in the natural world? We discussed how trains make you see movement even after you’re done traveling, but what about animals or plants or any naturally occurring illusions? Are there any creatures that have evolved to create illusions to help themselves? 

# Cortex

Quiz on brain regions (7-8 min, not 5 - it takes them some time)

Cortex:

* draw a brain
* locate primary cortices
* Locate in-betweens
  * Figure out the planning one
  * the spatial one
  * the language one
* Explain memory
* Language areas
  * Draw a typical path of connections for listening
  * For responding an email
* What about the right hemisphere?
  * prosody music
  * you caught a human in whom both hemispheres are heavily involved in language processing. What can you guess about him? (5 min)
* Differences between hemispheres
  * ask them to list what they heard, but also sort it into 3 buckets: seems right; probably an exaggeration; probably a myth (5 min)
  * debrief

# Language

1. How is Wernicke's aphasia different from Broca's?
2. Where are the Wernicke's and Broca's areas in the brain?
3. Can we see any logic in where they are located, that could help us to remember their role?

What have you ever heard about the differences between the left and right hemispheres, and what's your opinion about these statements? (Which sound like true, and which ones are fishy?)



Imagine that you ran a person through an fMRI (or fancy EEG) study, and realized that BOTH sides of their brain are really involved with language. What guesses can you make about this person?

# Emergency assignment

To get a pass:

1. Send me 5 topics **that you really care about**. We'll try to find a narrow topic at the intersection between these interests of yours, and Neuroscience
2. I'll pick one of those 5, adjust it a little bit, and send it back to you. It will become a topic of your work.
3. You'll need to go on Google Scholar and find 4 papers: 2 reviews, and 2 primary papers, on this topic.
4. Read them carefully.
5. Then, write a short essay (4-5 pages max, normal-spaced. So about 2000 words), informal, describing what you learned from these papers, how it relates to your interests, and what it could mean. Don't just summarize the papers (boring!). Write a bit about them, of course, but also make sure to mention why this topic matters to you, and how what you learned relates to the bigger picture.
6. Make sure to reference all 4 papers in the "References" section at the very end. (In Google Scholar, search for the article, click on the " ❞ " symbol under the search result, and copy the citation.)
7. The deadline for this assignment would be the end of completion week
