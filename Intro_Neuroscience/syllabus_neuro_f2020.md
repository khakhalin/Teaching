# Introduction to Neurobiology, Fall 2020

*Version: Aug 2020

# Course description

Many neuroscience textbooks begin with descriptions of brain's nuts-and-bolts (neurons, synapses, ion channels), while all fun topics (behavior, cognition, memory) get clumped at the end. This happens because most textbooks pretend to be discussing human brains, even though the majority of what we know about the brain we learned from model organisms, such as rats, flies, and sea slugs. In this course, we will gradually climb up the ladder of complexity: from single neurons in invertebrates, through small circuits in fishes and birds, and up to large-scale networks in primates, to see how simple elements can combine and interact to produce meaningful behaviors. Cross-listed in Brain Mind and Behavior.

# Course Goals

The ultimate goal of this course is to give you a chance to enjoy neuroscience. 

In practice, it means that by the end of this course, I want you to be able to slowly read a modern neuroscience paper. It won't be easy, as this field is highly specialized, but I want you to reach a point at which you could make it through a paper in a day or two.

And in turn, this means that by the end of the course you should:

* Understand and be able to explain several key neuroscience concepts
* Get better in navigating, reading, and analyzing science papers
* Become familiar with key methods used in neuro research
* Have a first idea about how to collect, analyze, and present experimental data

## General info

**Instructor:** Arseny Khakhalin; [khakhalin@bard.edu](mailto:khakhalin@bard.edu)

As we are still living through a pandemic, the course is taught online-only. The instruction will consist of several different independent parts:

* **Asynchronous** part:
  * **Assignments** (as well as all organizational info about the course) will be posted on **Piazza** (a special messaging board - see below).
  * **Lectures** will be posted on Youtube, with links on Piazza.
  * **Your participation** will also be gathered via Piazza. For the asynchronous part both sections of the course (all 50-60 people) will use the same messaging board.
* **Synchronous** part:
  * **Seminars**: we'll have classes (seminars, discussions), twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays (at different times for two different sections). These will happen via Zoom; the links will posted on Piazza.
  * **Labs**: we have lab time scheduled (again, split into two different groups: one on Thursday, another one on Friday). We will Zoom during this time, and either do, or discuss stuff. We won't be zooming for the entire 3 hours, but on some weeks we may zoom in the beginning, then work alone for an hour, then zoom again. The details will follow (in the weekly plan, and on Piazza)
  * **Office hours**: tbc.

### Asynchronous part (Youtube & Piazza)

The main way of communication for this course is the [**Piazza** discussion board](https://piazza.com/). It's a dedicated social media-like place created specifically for this course (something in-between reddit, quora, oldschool forums, and stackexchange).

* All announcements about the course will go on Piazza
* All materials for the course will be posted on Piazza.
* If you have general questions about the course, ask them on Piazza!
* For personal questions and updates, please use either office hours, or email
* Short homework assignments will be collected on Piazza. Please post them anonymously: I can still see who posted what, but your peers won't be able to see the author of a question / post.

By default it will also send updates to your emails, but I believe you can tune these updates to your liking, in the preferences. 

### Synchronous part (Zoom)

Make sure

# Reading materials

There is no printed textbook associated with the course, but we'll use a free online textbooks as our main textbook. You are also encouraged to use Wikipedia for simple questions, terms, and definition. Overall, this course is topic-based, not text based. It means that there's no canonical text to interpret; instead we would have a topic to learn, and you can use any resources you want to learn about it.

The best free Neuro textbook right now is the one from the University of Texas:
 https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/

If you need to go really deep, the magnificent Neuroscience grimoire by Dale Purves is also available online. For some weird copyright reasons you won't be able to browse it, but you can search within it, so just feed it some keywords and read the chapters that use these keywords:
 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10799/

Note that usually Neuro classes are taught at upper college, so you'll need to filter information. Your goal is to understand the basics, the get some general idea for HOW things work, not memorize all te currents, proteins, genes, brain regions etc. Look for the big picture, and then allow yourself to be creatively distracted by topics you like or care about. 

If you know nothing about the brain, and want to read some really basic intro first, consider the "NIH primer to Neuroscience" ([pdf link](http://www.brainfacts.org/about-neuroscience/brain-facts-book/~/media/Brainfacts/Article Multimedia/About Neuroscience/Brain Facts book.ashx)).

# Grading

This course is graded using a “Specification Grading” system, which is known to work better than the standard “Point-based” system, both in terms of final results, and student experience. The gist here is that each letter grade comes with a certain list of criteria, and it is up to you to pick the level you want to achieve.

To get a **C:** 

* Participate in 80% of classes
* Participate in 80% of labs
* Submit 60% of short written assignments (weekly reading reflections, labs, short exercises etc.) They don’t have to be perfect, but they need to be reasonable. If any given submission is problematic, I’ll let you know within a week, so that you could improve next time.

To get a **B:**

* Participate in 90% of classes
* Participate in 90% of labs
* Submit 90% of short written assignments
* Submit 2 reflective letters (each about 3 pages long; see the descriptions below). One before the mid-semester break; the other one before the completion week. The letters should be meaningful; if they are not, I’ll let you know, and give you a chance to resubmit.
* Come to office hours at least once.

To get an **A:**

* **On top of everything specified in “B”**, write a good final essay about a neuroscience paper; then meet with me during the completion week, to discuss both the paper and the essay. See the detailed instructions below.

# Attendance

If you miss more than 6 classes (labs and lectures combined) you will have to withdraw from the course. Please don't do it.

If you know in advance that you may have to miss a class, please let me (the instructor) know in advance!

# Academic integrity and plagiarism

For homework and in-class tests, the *writing* should be done by *you*. Borrowing texts from other people or from the internet without an acknowledgement (such citation, reference, explicit acknowledgement) is unacceptable, and will result in bad things happening.

At the same time, for most assignments, collaboration and team work are heavily encouraged. Seek inspiration by talking to your peers before doing your work! Show your work to other people and ask for their suggestions and feedback! Offer your help to struggling compatriots! Except for quizzes and exams, I expect you to do your own work, but also productively collaborate, as it happens in real life.

# Mutation clause

Instructor will continue to improve this syllabus during the semester, to make the course even more amazing (for example, move topics around if we are slow, change reading materials, etc.)

# Weekly Schedule

# Final essay

This assignment is only required if you want to go an extra mile (above a letter grad of“B”). If you put good work in it, you can get an “A”; if you don’t put enough work, you can get an “A minus”, or a “B plus”, depending on how far you get.

First, you need to find a neuroscience paper that you’d like to write about, from a journal named eLife ( https://elifesciences.org/ ). It is an open-access journal, so all papers are freely available online. It may make sense to find a paper that has something to do with something we learned in class, but if you want to go rogue, it is also possible(just make sure it’s neuroscience). Also, it has to be a primary paper: an experiment, a model, or a meta-analysis, but not a literature review, or an opinion piece. 

Send me an e-mail with a link to the paper, to claim it. If I think that the paper is a poor choice, I’ll let you know (it’s unlikely, but just in case). The earliest you can claim the paper is a week before the mid-semester recess. The latest you can claim it, is immediately before the completion week. But note that the more time you have, the better you can prepare, and the more feedback I can give you, when you ask for it.

Read the paper of your choice. Read some of the papers that it references, to learn the background (especially those referenced in the “introduction” section). Make sure you understand what question this paper asks, and why it is important. What are the consequences of knowing it? What are the hypotheses the authors had? You need to understand the methods. You need to know the figures, and understand what they are trying to say. You also need to read the exchanges that the authors and the reviewers had before the paper got accepted (eLife is one of the few journals that publish these exchanges openly). You need to get a good idea of what happened there, at the review stage; what the concerns were, and how the authors responded to these concerns.

Then write your essay. It cannot be longer than 2500 words (about 5 pages single-spaced), but it should clearly address the following points, in this order:

1. The rationale for the paper (what makes its question important), and some background needed to understand the study. Explain what we need to know before we even start reading the paper.
2. Why did you pick this paper, out of all neuro papers in this journal? Why this one?
3. The narrow question (or questions) the paper posed, and associated hypotheses (like, conceivably, what could be the answers to this question? What were even the options?)
4. Methods used. Don't describe them in detail (they are already described in the paper), but you need to have a decent grasp of the general idea of each method. Try to explain the essence of these methods in simple words. Try to outline weak and strong points of each of these methods, compared to others methods authors could have conceivably used (assuming similar time and financial budgets).
5. Figure by figure, the key message of each figure. Why are these figures even there? What panels are most critical within each figure? How do different figures speak to each other, and create a narrative? How do their messages support and advance the overall message of the paper?
6. The answer eventually provided by the paper. Make sure to refer back to the narrow question the authors posed, and the hypotheses they had. What does this answer mean, in a broader scale of things?
7. What are the limitations of this study? What follow-up studies can be inspired by this study? Some of these are probably outlined in the Discussion, some may be identified from the peer review materials, some you can discover yourself. Make sure to go beyond the obvious; if a limitation is true for every paper ever written, it is probably not the most useful thing to discuss.

You need to submit the final version of the essay by the first day of completion week, and we’ll schedule a meeting to talk about it. In the meeting, we will discuss the original paper that you were writing about, using your essay to answer the questions outlined above. 

There will be a deadline to submit a draft version of your essay. If you submit something by this deadline, I will read your draft, and give you some feedback. We can also meet during drop-in hours, to talk about your project (it's not required, but we may, if you prefer to).

The measure of success here is the depth of your research towards understanding this one single paper. Some topics, methods, and analyses are inherently more complicated, while some are simpler, so we are not going after some predefined level that you need to reach. Rather, I want to see your independent work, and your ability to use what we learned in class to learn more science on your own. If the paper is “easy”, I will expect a deeper understanding of it, and I may ask more follow-up questions in our meeting. If the paper is hard or long, a deep understanding of only one part of it, perhaps as little as one figure, may suffice. Again, what matters here is the amount of thought you put in your project. You definitely don’t need to become perfect (it is impossible to know everything!!) but you need to kinda become a specialist in this one particular paper, compared to a person reading it for the first time.
