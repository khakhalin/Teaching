# Existential Neuroscience, Spring 2021

*Version: Jan 23 2021*

# Course Goals

The ultimate goal of this course is to give you a chance to enjoy neuroscience. 

In practice, it means that by the end of this course, I want you to be able to slowly read a modern neuroscience paper. It won't be easy, as this field is highly specialized, but I want you to reach a point at which you can make it through an unfamiliar paper in a day or so.

In turn, this means that by the end of the course you should:

* Understand and be able to explain a set of key neuroscience concepts
* Get better in navigating, reading, and analyzing science papers
* Become familiar with key methods used in neuro research
* Learn some important terminology (again, to make it easier to read papers)
* Understand how neuroscience relates to other areas of knowledge (evolution, human psychology, robotics, philosophy etc.)
* Develop an idea about how to collect, analyze, and present experimental data

## Course Logistics

**Instructor:** Arseny Khakhalin (pronounced: ar-SEH-ny ha-HA-leen; ipa: ɑr'sʲenʲi xa'xalʲin); [khakhalin@bard.edu](mailto:khakhalin@bard.edu)

As we are still in a pandemic, with new strains emerging, the course is online-only. The instruction will consist of several parts:

* **Asynchronous** part:
  * **Assignments and questions on Piazza** - a special messaging board for teaching. All readings, videos, labs, and all organizational info will be posted there! See below for details.
  * **Online readings** (no need to buy anything)
  * **Lectures** on Youtube
  * Interactive interactions on Piazza (I won't be able to respond to every post and every assignment, but I will definitely respond to some)
* **Synchronous** part:
  * **Zoom Seminars**: we'll have classes (seminar discussions) twice a week, on **Monday and Thursday, 8:30-9:50 am EST**.
  * **Labs**: we have virtual and remote labs. On some days we'll connect on Zoom (**Tuesday, 8:30-9:50 am EST**), and run the lab realtime. On some weeks the lab will be fully online (I'll give you a link, and you'll do the lab at your own pace, then submit your results). On some weeks we may also do a mixed approach: either first have the lab, then discuss the results on Zoom, or first briefly talk on Zoom, then run the lab. *Note that on BIP it says that labs are running till 10:30; this is genrally not true, as I found that 2-3 hours is too long for virtual labs. On some days I may use this time for office hours, but Zoom calls for labs proper will be over by 9:50.*
  * **Office hours**: Office hours will look like a Zoom call that you can join if you want to. With that many students I don't think we can afford to have 1:1 office hours, so it will look more like an additional study section. You log in, you ask questions, I try to answer them :) Although if you have a more private question, you are always welcome to send me an email, and will figure something out. Time: **TBC**

> 💡 On time commitment: You need to plan about 10 hours of work a week for one full course (4 Bard credits). The logic is simple: full-time learning should be equivalent to full-time work. Both because a full-time working week is known to be doable (not too long, not too short), and because it gives people enough spare time to  care about their family, side job, hobbies, social life, or whatever. A full-time job is 40 hours a week, and a "full load" in college is 4 full courses per semester, therefore 1 course should take about 10 hours a week, total. 
>
> In this course, we'll be spending 3-4 hours a week in meetings (2 class Zooms + a lab Zoom on some weeks), which means that the remaining 6-7 hours a week you should spend studying on your own.  Say, 2 hours to watch all videos, 2 hours to read extra materials, 1 hour for a lab, 30 min to write your responses, maybe 30 min for office hours. Something like that. 
>
> If at some point you realize that you're spending less time on this course (or any other course really), you're not learning as much as you could. If you realize that you are spending more time, it's a potential problem, as it may damage your work/life balance, or harm your other courses. So if it happens with this course, definitely let me know, and we'll figure something out!

### Piazza

The main way of communication for this course is the [**Piazza** discussion board](https://piazza.com/). It's a dedicated social media-like place created specifically for this course (something in-between reddit, quora, internet forums, and stackexchange).

* All announcements about the course will go on Piazza
* All materials for the course will be posted on Piazza.
* If you have general questions about the course, ask them on Piazza!
* For personal questions and updates, please use either office hours, or email
* Short homework assignments will be collected on Piazza. Please post them anonymously: I can still see who posted what, but your peers won't be able to see the author of a question / post.

> 💡 By default, Piazza will send updates to your email about any change, and every post. Even if you use auto-filtering in your gmail folders (and I do definitely recommend that you set up filtering!), it quickly gets overwhelming. So personally, I recommend that you disable all emails from Piazza, and just visit it regularly during the week.

If Piazza is down, send me an email. We'll switch to emails temporarily, until it is fixed.

### Reading materials

All required materials will be posted on line (on Piazza).

We have no conventional textbook in this course, but I'll give links a free online textbook from the University of Texas. It doesn't follow our course exactly, but it's a very decent manual. This textbook has lots of "interactive illustrations" that you can use to better understand the topics, but they were coded in Flash, and Flash is now considered obsolete. On most browsers you can still make it work, but you may need to make a few clicks, to manually enable Flash.
 https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/

Note that Neuro classes are often taught in upper college, so when reading any materials, you'll need to filter information. Your goal is to understand the basics, and get some general idea for HOW things work, not memorize all the currents, proteins, genes, brain regions etc. Look for the big picture; don't get intimidated by all the details. You can learn details of one or two topics later, if (when) you need it. In this course, we go for the gist.

### Youtube

All lectures will be posted on Youtube, chopped in several 20-30 minutes long pieces. Your task will be to watch them in time for the discussion sessions. 

> 💡 A tangent: I cannot control it, of course, but I strongly suggest that you try to set up a working place, and listen to lectures on your computer (not an phone). Phones are tempting, but what will end up happening is that you'll be multitasking, and you won't be able to take notes. And listening to lectures without taking notes is practically useless (it will feel like you learned something, but actually you'll forget it within just few days). This is true even for live lectures, but for Youtube lectures it is quadruple more so, as there will always be a little voice in your head saying: "*this youtube videos is never going anywhere... you can always watch it again later if you need to...*" But let's be honest, you won't. So take a notebook (or use note-talking software if you prefer paperless life), and take notes.
>
> The best way to listen to a lecture is to:
>
> * Set the playback speed at 125-150% (depending on the speaker)
> * Pause often
> * Make predictions about what the lector is about to say next, or where this whole story will go
> * Take notes. Make sure to write down things you didn't understand, didn't like, or disagreed with. In many ways, these are most important aspects of the experience. Try to make your notes better, and more organized than the lecture.
>
> In my lectures, I will also sometimes pose questions, and pause. In a real class I would often ask a question, pause, and let people think about it, discuss it, and try to answer it, before going further. On youtube, I will just pause briefly, but I encourage you to pause the video and actually think about the question, *as if you were in class*. Pause, think, formulate your answer, then continue and compare your answer with whatever I say next.

### Zoom

Zoom meetings will start on times indicated on BIP. On some days we may end them a bit earlier, but the start times are given on BIP. Also, for lab sessions, we may try to Zoom briefly, then do some work at home, then Zoom again and discuss.

* Make sure you put your full name on Zoom. Use the **name that you want people to actually use** (especially if it differs from your legal name). Please don't use gaming nicks (like BobbyCake666 :) 
* When setting a Zoom account, **put your Bard email** there. I will use emails as ids when taking attendance (Zoom auto-generates meeting logs, so I will just download them, and run a program to see who attended and who didn't). If you don't put your email on Zoom, I won't be able to give you an attendance point.
* Try to **connect to Zoom with your computer** (not with a phone). Again, in a pinch you can try to connect from your phone (it's probably better than not connecting at all), but we'll be doing stuff during these meetings (I will share quizzes, give you links to sites, and what not), so being at your working computer would make things so much easier.
* **Try to have your camera on.** Now, this is a tricky point, as some people cannot have their cameras on: maybe they live with roommates who are not always fully clothed, or they don't want to show their brother's Avengers poster, or they have a really bad connection... But if the entire class has their cameras off, it will look sad; we'll miss on the social aspect of it, and it will be infinitely harder for me to teach. So if you can afford to have a camera on, please consider doing so! I for one will be extremely grateful to you! It's not a requirement, but a request, if possible.
* Every now and then, on Zoom, I will send you to auto-generated random "**Breakout rooms**": small chats for 3-4 people, to discuss questions. There are two reasons we are doing it. One, I want you to interact with each other at least somewhat. Second, educational research has shown that when students try to talk to each other about what they learn, they learn MUCH better. Not all people realize that (some are like "I want things to be explained to me by a prof, not by some rando"), but actually it's a proven fact. Peer-learning works so well because people often have similar misunderstandings, and talking them through helps. And another, trying to explain something to another person is actually the best way to understand, and thus learn this "something". So be ready for breakout rooms.
* **Be ready to participate** in class (using your voice). I will be mostly asking some breakout rooms to share what they discussed, but sometimes I may call people at random as well (I'll code a random student generator for this purpose :)
* **Keep Zoom on "mute" when not talking.** When speaking, unmute. Once you're done, please mute back. If you need to add something, unmute again, add something, then mute back :)
* If the instructor disappears from Zoom (because a tree fell in a forest and restarted all computers in the village), please wait for about 10 minutes. It takes my routers about 5 min to restart, so I should be able to be back in this time. If you can **self-organize and keep doing something useful** - even better!
* If Zoom is down and you can't connect - **send your instructor an email**. We always have Google Meetings as a back-up option.

# Weekly Reading Reflection

The most regular and predictable assignment for this course will be the **weekly reading reflection**, or **weekly question**. Every week, after watching the lectures, and reading the materials, I will ask you to think 

# Grading

This course is graded using a “Specification Grading” system, which was shown to work better than the standard “Point-based” system, both in terms of final results (students learn more!), and student experience (students are more happy). The gist here is that each letter grade comes with a certain list of criteria, and it is up to you to pick the level that you want to achieve.

To get a **C:** 

* Participate in 80% of classes
* Submit 80% of assignments (reading reflections, labs, short exercises etc.) on time. The submissions don’t have to be perfect, but they need to be reasonable (present some evidence of work). If a submission is problematic, I’ll let you know, so that you could improve next time.

To get a **B:**

* Participate in 90% of classes
* Submit 90% of short written assignments

To get an **A:**

* **On top of everything specified in “B”**, write a good final essay about a neuroscience paper. See the detailed instructions at the end of this document. We may also have some sort of "paper presentation session" for those that decide to try it.

# Attendance and late policy

If you miss more than two weeks worth of classes, you will have to withdraw from the course. Please don't do it!

I'll spend the first 5 minutes of each class waiting for those that are late. That is, if a meeting is scheduled for 1 pm, Zoom will open at 1 pm (maybe at 12:55 or something), and we'll be just chatting until 1:05. At 1:05 sharp we will start the class. Students who join later that this 5-min waiting period will be considered "late". Three late arrivals will be equivalent to one missed class.

# Academic integrity and plagiarism

For all homework assignments, the *writing* should be done by *you*. Borrowing *texts* from other people or from the internet without an acknowledgement (such as a citation, a reference, an explicit acknowledgement) is unacceptable, and will result in bad things happening.

At the same time, for most assignments, collaboration and team work are heavily encouraged. Seek inspiration by talking to your peers before doing your work! Show your work to other people and ask for their suggestions and feedback! Offer your help to struggling brothers and sisters! I expect you to do your own work, but also productively collaborate, as that's how it happens in real life.

# Mutation clause

Instructor will continue to improve this syllabus during the semester, to make the course even more amazing (for example, move topics around if we are slow, change reading materials, etc.)

The changes will never be retroactive though! If a rule changes, it will only apply to future assignments, not to past assignments :)

# DRAFT Weekly Schedule

**Please, rely on weekly posts on Piazza for homework. This plan below is roughly correct, but needs some fine-tuning ;)**
